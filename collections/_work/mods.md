Mods, based in Stockholm, Sweden, is one of the world's leading retouching companies.

I joined Mods as a freelance mobile engineer, to help them get a new app off the ground. This involved SwiftUI, SPM, and integrating with remote, image processing APIs.

While the app is not yet live, I can (given Mods focus on image retouching) share that the app uses smart, on-device camera capabilities, image analysis and remote image-based workflows to do some pretty cool things.
