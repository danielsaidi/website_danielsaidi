While this is a tech focused blog, where I generally keep politics out, I believe that reflecting on how US big tech is changing *is*, in fact, tech related. So, here are my 5 cents, and my plans for the future.

## Other voices

For other takes on this topic, I highly recommend [Matt Massicotte's blog post]({{page.mattie}}) and Marco Arment's & David Smith's podcast [Under the Radar - Our Changing Relationship with Apple]({{page.radar}}).


## A new normal

With the wide-spread assumption that the 2016 election was a glitch, most US tech companies held their ground, seemingly waiting for a return to normal.

As the 2024 election proved such assumptions wrong, the masks came off as US Big Tech rushed to hail the return of the king. Sponsoring and endorsing, with their necks bent and mouths shut.

For me, the hardest part has been to see Apple play its part in this travesty. Apple has been deeply flawed in recent years, but what they do now - or rather don't do - is something that I can't accept.

As Matt Massicotte writes in [his blog post]({{page.mattie}}), "Apple is supporting a regime that is not just destroying democracy in the United States, but is actively working to do so globally."

This is no understatement. Apple *is* supporting a regime that is lashing out against allies, attacking countries like Canada and Denmark while cozying up to Russia.

The way that Apple is actively supporting and passively watching this coup happen is unforgivable.


## What will I do?

While my work makes it hard to opt-out of US tech altogether, I will vote with my wallet and reduce the amount of time and passion I give to these companies and their platforms.

I have already scaled down my presence on X and will expand this to Meta's platforms as well. I will cancel all US streaming accounts, but will let my children keep one service at a time. 

I don't want my convictions to affect my children the way US boycotts in Sweden impacted some of my friends in the â€™80s. I will share my reasoning with them and let them decide.

Regarding Apple, this is where scaling down is most difficult. I'm deeply invested in their ecosystem, so I have to make pragmatic decisions that still align with my values.

My strategy is therefore to avoid buying anything from Apple that I don't *truly* need. No test devices, no unnecessary Vision Pro, and no Apple TV+ or Apple Music. Just the bare minimum.

Like [Matt Massicotte]({{page.mattie}}), I will also stop using the Feedback Assistant for constructive feedback and will no longer put any personal effort into improving Apple's ecosystem.

Not going to WWDC would be a hard choice, since it's a rare opportunity to meet so many amazing developers in the community. I will to give it some serious thought.

I will however continue to build open-source tools, and to do my best to support others. I will keep building fun stuff that I want to use and that might benefit others.

I will do my best to honor this as long as Apple remains silent and complicit. Only a genuine apology will do - one that truly acknowledges their silence and accepts its consequences.

I hope that everyone at Apple and everyone in the US tech scene who still believe in tech as a force for good will make your voices heard and help put an end to this travesty.

Love.
