I have a license for R# at work. It's a really nice utility that saves me a lot of
time. Besides providing a lot of shortcuts and extensions to Visual Studio, it also
integrates NUnit in a convenient way.

I don't have R# at home and really miss the NUnit integration. However, I found a
workaround in the Visual NUnit 2010 extension, which has a nice NUnit view that can
be embedded within Visual Studio.

Visual NUnit 2010 can be downloaded [here]({{page.download}}). After installing, you
will find the Visual NUnit view under `View/Other views`.

To make things even smoother, I have pinned the Visual NUnit view to the bottom
of Visual Studio, which makes it instantly available as soon as I run my tests.
