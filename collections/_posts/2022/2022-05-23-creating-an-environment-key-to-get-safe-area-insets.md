In this post, we'll take a look at how to create a custom SwiftUI environment key that lets us get the safe area insets for the current scene.

{% include kankoda/data/open-source.html name="SwiftUIKit" %}

SwiftUI has many great environment values, with more being added over some information isn't available in the convenient way that we may have come to expect.

One example is safe area insets, where SwiftUI offers different ways to get the insets of a certain view. One way is to use the `.safeAreaInset` view modifier, which was added in iOS 15 and described [here]({{page.hackingwithswift}}). You can also use a `GeometryReader`, which proxy has these insets.

You may however need to access the safe area insets of the screen, not the view itself. For instance, if you make a ignore the safe area insets, t becomes zero for the entire hierarchy.

I'd love for SwiftUI to provide environments for the safe area insets of the view, the scene, the screen etc. but until Apple adds this to SwiftUI, we can implement it ourselves.

Let's start with a few extensions. For UIKit, we need the key window, which we get like this:

```swift
#if os(iOS) || os(tvOS)
private extension UIApplication {

    var keyWindow: UIWindow? {
        connectedScenes
            .filter { $0.activationState == .foregroundActive }
            .compactMap { $0 as? UIWindowScene }
            .flatMap { $0.windows }
            .filter { $0.isKeyWindow }
            .first
    }
}
#endif
```

Note that `UIWindow` is only available in iOS & tvOS, which is why we wrap the code in `#if`.

We must also convert the UIKit-specific window insets to SwiftUI, which we can do like this:

```swift
#if canImport(UIKit)
private extension UIEdgeInsets {
    
    var edgeInsets: EdgeInsets {
        .init(top: top, leading: left, bottom: bottom, trailing: right)
    }
}
#endif
```

We can now define a custom environment key for reading this safe area inset value:

```swift
private struct SafeAreaInsetsKey: EnvironmentKey {
    
    static var defaultValue: EdgeInsets {
        #if os(iOS) || os(tvOS)
        let keyWindow = UIApplication.shared.keyWindow
        return keyWindow?.safeAreaInsets.edgeInsets ?? EdgeInsets()
        #else
        EdgeInsets()
        #endif
    }
}
```

For iOS & tvOS, we return the key window's safe area insets, if any, while other platforms like watchOS & macOS just get a zero-valued result.

To use this new key, we can extend `EnvironmentValues` with a new `safeAreaInsets` value:

```swift
public extension EnvironmentValues {
    
    var safeAreaInsets: EdgeInsets {
        self[SafeAreaInsetsKey.self]
    }
}
```

You can now get the safe area insets of the current scene like this:

```swift
struct MyView: View {

    @Environment(\.safeAreaInsets)
    private var insets: EdgeInsets

    var body: some View {
        Text("\(insets.bottom)")
    }
}
```

This would render different texts if you run the code on an iPhone 13 or an iPhone SE, regardless if you ignore safe area insets anywhere in your view hierarchy.


## Conclusion

I hope you liked this way of adding custom environment values. You can find this code in the [SwiftUIKit]({{project.url}}) library. Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think.
