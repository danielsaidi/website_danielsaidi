Lunchrrrrr is a small app that I created with friends many years ago. The new version has been rewritten for iOS 16, and has a cleaner UI as well as improved drag responsiveness.

{% include kankoda/data/app.html name="Lunchrrrrr" %}
{% include kankoda/data/open-source.html name="ApiKit" %}{% assign apikit = project %}
{% include kankoda/data/open-source.html name="DeckKit" %}{% assign deckkit = project %}

{% include kankoda/grids/grid-screenshots.html images="lunchrrrrr-iphone-1,lunchrrrrr-iphone-2,lunchrrrrr-iphone-3" %}

Lunchrrrrr lets you find nearby restaurants, using the Yelp v3 API. It lets you swipe through restaurants like other card-based apps, like Tinder.

Although this app was created for fun, it's a pretty well-crafted app that uses [DeckKit]({{deckkit.url}}) to render the deck of cards and [ApiKit]({{apikit.url}}) to integrate with the Yelp API.

When creating this version, I could remove a lot of code due to new language features in Swift and new capabilities in the libraries. I also moved the Yelp API integration to ApiKit.

For more information about Lunchrrrrr, [download the app from the AppStore]({{app.appstore}}), or checkout the [app page]({{app.url}}) at the [Kankoda]({{site.kankoda}}) website.
