A while back, I wrote an article about how to bring undimmed presentation detents to SwiftUI. Since then, Xcode 14 has changed things in a way that required the original implementation to change. 

The original post has therefore been updated with new information and capabilities. You can see all the updated information in the [original post]({{page.article}}).
