I love HTML5, although it will take time for many browsers to support HTML5. 
Until they do, our code must be supported by older browsers as well. What if
I told you that there's a way to write HTML5 today, and automatically have it
convert to HTML4 whenever needed?

To make it possible to write HTML5 and still support older browsers, I created a
class that automatically converts most new HTML5 elements to HTML4 elements when
the response is sent to the client.

For instance, <nav>...</nav> is translated to `...`.

for Internet Explorer 8 (which doesn't support HTML5), while Chrome and Firefox
will receive the original HTML5 code (since they support it).


## The basic implementation

First of all, HTML5 support is determined by a class that implements a small
interface. If the browser is considered to **not** support HTML5, the HTML5 code
is converted to HTML4, using another class.

The interface-based setup makes it easy to replace these implementations with
better ones, if they prove insufficient in the future. For instance, maybe you
want to use a complete list of non-HTML5 browsers (here, we only consider IE8
and below to not have HTML5 support) and perhaps do not want the class name to be
applied to the end tag (which the current implementation adds).

If you feel like improving these classes, feel free to send a pull request with a
better implementation ðŸ™‚


## The ugly test hack

We tested this approach by applying it in the Render event of a web form master
page. It worked like a charm. When browsing the web site with Firefox, Chrome
etc. we got the original HTML5:

However, in Internet Explorer 8, we get a converted HTML4 version:

But wait a minute! Applying this in the Render event of the master page? That is,
really bad, isn't it? Yes, you are right. As I wrote, we were just trying it out.

## The pretty final solution

I guess we can all agree that we want to make this conversion independent of our
code. The solution above (applying it in the Render event) only works for Web
Forms-based solutions. What if we want to automatically convert HTML5 to HTML4 in
an ASP.NET MVC-based web site?

I therefore created an HttpModule that applies an HTML5 conversion filter to the
outgoing response. This will automatically handle all outgoing responses, if the
module is registered in web.config.

To enable the module, actions differ depending on which IIS setup you are using.

If you are using IIS 7.0 running in Integrated mode, you must add the following
tag to the web.config system.webServer modules section:

```xml
<add name="NExtra.Web.HttpModules.Html5ElementConvertHttpModule" type="NExtra.Web.HttpModules.Html5ElementConvertHttpModule, NExtra, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral" />
```

If you are using IIS 6.0 or IIS 7.0 running in Classic mode (this also applies to
the dev server), add the following to the web.config system.web httpModules section:

```xml
<add name="NExtra.Web.HttpModules.Html5ElementConvertHttpModule" type="NExtra.Web.HttpModules.Html5ElementConvertHttpModule, NExtra, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral" />
```

That should be all you have to do to enable automatic HTML5 to HTML4 conversion.

All the best!
