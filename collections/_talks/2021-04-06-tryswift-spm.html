  I gave this workshop at the try! Swift World online conference in
  2021. In it, we look at how to use the Swift Package Manager (SPM)
  to distribute closed-source software and protect our secret sauce.

conference-abstract: |
  Open-source is an amazing way to contribute to the developer community. However, there may come a time when you want to keep your source code closed and not share it with the world. Perhaps you want to protect some sophisticated or business-critical piece of logic or distribute it with a commercial license?

  In this workshop, we will look at how to use the Swift Package Manager (SPM) to distribute closed-source software. We will create an open-source library from scratch and extend it with pro features in a closed-source, pre-compiled framework, then use SPM to distribute both libraries. We will also look at how to work around some of the current limitations that exist with SPM. We will start from the very basics, so you will be able to follow along even if you haven't used SPM before.
