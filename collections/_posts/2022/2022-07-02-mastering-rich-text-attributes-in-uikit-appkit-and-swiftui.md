In this post, we'll look at how to handle rich text attributes in a rich text editor that supports UIKit, AppKit and SwiftUI. We'll look at how to get and set attributes for a certain range as well as for the current position, and how to derive more functionality from a basic set of operations.

Attributes
Traits
Alignment is a future post


## Conclusion

Although UIKit and AppKit has a bunch of built-in support for rich text, a lot is still missing. I hope that this post has made some things clearer and that you found the various examples interesting. 

You can find the source code in the [RichTextKit]({{page.richtextkit}}) library, which I will evolve over time.

Thanks for reading!
