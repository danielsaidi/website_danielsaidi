If you remember your name
you'll be defined by it

The sun is up, the day is bright
But you my Love
You're out of sight
My heart is where the ocean is
Meet me there
Meet me there

I heard you cry the other day
Something about a grand escape
We used to dream about that leap
Over the ocean wide
The ocean wide

If you remember your name
you'll be defined by it

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When you don't want to
I know it's hard to be a part of it all
When you don't want to
When you don't want to
