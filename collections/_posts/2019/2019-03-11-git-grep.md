This is a short note to self about how to use `git grep` instead of `grep` to find all occurrences of a certain text in all files within a root folder.

I used to use `grep` to do this, but always had to lookup the syntax. Also, it's not as quick and intuitive as I'd like it to be.

However, `git grep` is a lot faster and much easier to use than `grep`. To use `git grep` instead of `grep`, you just have to type:

```
git grep 'the string to search for'
```

To narrow it down to only search in certain types of files, just add a file pattern:

```
git grep 'the string to search for' *.txt
```

This is a lot cleaner and MUCH faster than `grep`.
