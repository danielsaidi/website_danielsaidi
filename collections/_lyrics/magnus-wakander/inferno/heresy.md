The sun his father
Alone to rule this realm
The priests have fallen
Their temples laid to waste

Transformed
From man to deity
Now reigns supreme
Through heresy

Masses
Suppressed 
As their borders fall
Cities
In waste
As they lose it all

Through heresy enthroned
But not for long

Masses
Unrest
As their cities fall
A land
In ruins
As they lose it all

The son of Aton
The fall of Thebe
The priests abolished
The sun disc’s unleashed

Enthroned, not flesh
Now deity
Now reigns supreme
Through heresy

The son of Aton
Won’t be for long
The priests are stirring
From behind his throne

Betrayed
Because of heresy
Just flesh, just man
Not deity

Masses
Flows through
His burning gates
A man
In chains
Now faces their hate

Through heresy dethroned
Now enslaved in stone

Masses
Enslaves
Him inside
Idol
Enslaved
Bides his time
