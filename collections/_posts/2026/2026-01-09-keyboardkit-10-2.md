KeyboardKit 10.2 is out! This release adds a [new dictation engine]({{page.release}}) and many new settings, as well as several bug fixes and improvements.

The keyboard only opens the main app to start dictation, after which it keeps an active connection and performs dictation in the background, with seamless data synchronization between the targets.

The new in-keyboard dictation is a huge step forward. It makes voice-based operations significantly easier to use in keyboard extensions, while keeping everything private and entirely on-device.

This means that developers and startups can now compete with big players like Google’s Gboard, and Microsoft’s SwiftKey, to provide amazing, voice-based features in their custom keyboards.

The next step is to make it easier to route the dictated text to destinations other than the main text document, like a local or remote AI model.
