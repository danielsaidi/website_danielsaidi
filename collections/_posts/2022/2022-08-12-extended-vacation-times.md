As the Swedish summer keeps on delivering, I'm struggling to combine full-time work with open-source projects, a big iOS 16 and SwiftUI 4 app project and this blog.

I had initially planned to be back in action in August, and while that is true in some sense, I find it hard to focus on this blog at the moment. I'm currently working full-time with a client project, working on a majore update of an app of mine while I also have open-source feature requests and a bunch of things to fix in KeyboardKit Pro.

So, instead of burning out, I will chill with this blog for a while. I want this to be lust-driven and not a stress factor. I will write new posts whenever I find fun things to write about, but will not aim at covering a certain number of posts per week.

Until I'm back at full blogging capacity, I'm sure that you will find new, exciting content from all parts of the amazing Swift and SwiftUI community.

Love

Daniel
