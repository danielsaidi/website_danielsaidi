As some of my projects are coming together, I want to move them from Google Code to GitHub. Tonight, I decided to give it a try and say hello to git and GitHub.

I first visited the [Git download page](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/) and downloaded the latest git release for OS X. Since configuring git involves a few of steps, I found [this page](http://help.github.com/mac-git-installation/) really helpful. 

After installing it, I found myself typing commands into the Terminal without understanding anything. Pull? Fetch? Clone? What the hell is going on? I guess I have a lot to learn.

Nevertheless, my projects eventually ended up on GitHub and I now have an incentive to master git. If I don't, I'll never see my source code again.
