Talk to this shell in front of you
All that you like
He just isn’t there
A shattered conscience
You can’t keep it in
When it’s clawing out
You can’t contain
What won’t stay inside
It’s too late to lock it in
It’s too late to block me out

Die!
All who tried
You never could see inside
His lies was truths denied
You realize as I rise
You tried to cure his sins
You never could, you never did
I’m back, in your world again
Leaving my nest
Bringing the end

For one final time
I’m crossing the line
Unleashed in my prime
Outgrown this skin of man
This human mind is
Split, I’m coming out

To all who tried
You can not hide
It is time to fry
In the flames of old
You’re gonna see the truth in all the lies he told
Why as you took it in
Did you ever believe that you could lock me in
I’m back, in your world again
Leaving my nest
Bringing the end

For one final time
I’m crossing the line
Unleashed in my prime
Outgrown this skin of man
This human mind is
Split, I’m coming out

Die!
All who tried
To bind me up deep inside
His lies was truths denied
You realize as I rise
You failed to cure his sins
Did you ever believe that you could lock me in
I’m back, in your world again
Leaving my nest
Bringing the end

For one final time
I’m crossing the line
Unleashed in my prime
Split this host of man
This human shell is coming off
