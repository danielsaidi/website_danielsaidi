Paid in full to walk his path
To carry out his deeds
A golden crown the reward
A hollowed soul the price

His halls of riches now our home
The wealth of Belphegor
The linings in our clothes
The wiring of our souls
This realm of pure excess
The wealth of Belphegor
Corruption of the mind
Paid and sold

Belphegor, lord of the wealthy
Pay us and we will betray
Mark us, brand us like kettle 
Pay us and we will obey
Belphegor, lord of the wealthy
Pay us, lead us astray
Flay us, skin us to the bone 
Lead us into our grave

Came in times of need
Of sorrow and despair
The hunger of our kin
Stirred our greed
Gave more than enough
Excess beyond belief
A savior of these lands
We took his hand

Paid in full to walk his path
To carry out his sins
A molten crown the reward
A ruined soul the price

These walls of gold an open cell
The wealth of Belphegor
Like fire in our flesh
Like lava through our veins
This realm of pure distress
The wealth of Belphegor
Destruction of the mind
Paid and sold

Belphegor, lord of the wealthy
Pay us and we will betray
Brand us, lead us like kettle 
Pay us and we will obey
Belphegor, lord of the wealthy
Pay us, lead us astray
Flay us, skin us to the bone 
Lead us into our grave

Gave in to the greed
Despair of misled men
The hunger in our souls
Gold canâ€™t feed
More but not enough
Distress and endless grief
A curse upon these lands
Gold-filled hands

These walls of gold an open cell
The wealth of Belphegor
Like fire in our flesh
Like lava through our veins
This realm of pure distress
The wealth of Belphegor
Destruction of the mind
Paid and sold
