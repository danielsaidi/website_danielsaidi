What once started as a fun hobby project for me and two friends has kept going over the years, and is now updated with a cleaner design and brand new support for IDs, travel documents, and tickets.

What began as a simple digital wallet has evolved through countless iOS updates, design paradigm shifts, and technology changes. It's as basic as before, but polished to be even easier to use.

Despite the challenges of keeping the old skeuomorphic design relevant, there's something deeply satisfying about maintaining this old-school experience, and not bloat it with too much stuff.

</div>

The journey of keeping Wally going for over a decade has been challenging and rewarding. Various iOS updates have brought new hurdles, but also opportunities to refine and improve while staying true to Wally's core charm. 

Wally is by no means a revenue machine, but rather a fun project where I get to try out new SwiftUI features and eat my own dog food. I truly believe that it has made me a better developer over time.

If you're interested in trying the latest version, I'd love your feedback. You can download Wally to your iPhone or iPad from the [App Store]({{page.appstore}}).
