I joined Rakveres in 2001. We started off covering bands like Weezer, Danzig and Nirvana, but soon started writing our own songs, of which we recorded a few.

Rakveres was a fun band, and the one in which I wrote my greatest song. "Sweet Girls" was written on a boat between Estonia and Sweden, as we tried to kill boredom with beer. It worked.
