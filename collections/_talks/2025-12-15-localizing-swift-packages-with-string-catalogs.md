abstract: |  
  This talk explores Xcode string catalogs and the drastic improvemenets introduced in Xcode 26. We will look at the key differences between app and package localization and common pitfalls.
  
  We'll also look at how we can use Xcode 26's new symbol generation to get compile-time safety, and how to set up a shared translation package that can be used by many packages and apps.

I will give this talk at [{{page.location}}]({{page.location-url}}), on how to localize Swift packages with String Catalogs, and how to create a central localization package that can be shared across multiple apps and packages.

This page will be available after the talk. You can read more about this talk [here]({{page.post-1}}) and see [this article]({{page.post-2}}) for a complete implementation.
