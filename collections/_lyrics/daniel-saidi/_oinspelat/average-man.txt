Average man


I once had a band,
now it's gone with that man
I once had big plans
now they're gone with that band
Cause in the end I did not have just what it takes
Me a fake
I once was grand
Now I'm just an average man

Everybody knows the price to pay
Everybody knows what's at stake
Everybody knows, I know
and I know that I knew
'cause I thew it all away

I once had some friends
now they're gone, with that band
We shared great plans
But they slipped out of hand
Cause in the end we did not have just what it takes
Us a fake
I once was grand
Now I'm just an average man

Everybody knows the price to pay
Everybody knows what's at stake
Everybody knows, I know
and I know that I knew
'cause I thew it all away

I once had a band
I guess it wasn't that grand
I once had some friends
They're still there, in the end
We once had big plans
now we're just family men

Everybody knows the price to pay
Everybody knows what's at stake
Everybody knows, I know
and I know that I knew
'cause I thew it all away
