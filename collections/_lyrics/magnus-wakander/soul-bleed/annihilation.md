We are never gonna serve on bended knees
We are never gonna serve you our defeat
Face to face, fate to fate
Glory to the brave
We are never gonna serve on bended knees

We will never let you back down or retreat
We will never let you leave our lands in peace
Mace to face, face your fate
Bodies to the flames

We will annihilate
Until nothing’s left
We will annihilate
Until nothing’s left

We will torture you as long as you can feel
We will torture your remains before your kin
Break, break, break, slay, slay, slay
Your flesh on our plates
We will torture you as long as you can feel

We will let your children serve on broken knees
We are gonna let them burn up in defeat
We will torture them as long as they exist
We will annihilate them out of history
