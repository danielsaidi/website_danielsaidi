Anomaly Software is an Australian-based tech-company that hired me for keyboard-related work and sponsored my [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) open source project.

One of their custom keyboards has a custom autocomplete engine that provides translations between various indigenous languages. It was really cool to see [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) be used for something like that.

Thanks to Anomaly Software, [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) has improved support for autocomplete. These features are available for both UIKit and SwiftUI. Big thanks to Anomaly Software for sponsporing [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}})!
