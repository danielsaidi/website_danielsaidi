This Øredev 2013 session was a masterpiece, where Shay Friedman blasted through 30 NuGet packages in 50 minutes.

The night before this talk, I went to bed at 2 am after a night out with my great colleagues from eBay Sweden. To avoid having a day with heavy lids,  I calculated that going to bed at 2 am would give me 6 hours of sleep. More than enough (I get by on 4). The perfect plan.

At 5 am, I was woken up by the world ending. Or so I thought, as I was violently pulled out of sleep after just 3 hours. Looking out of the poorly isolated window with my heart racing, I saw to two huge machines tearing up the asphalt right outside my window. The sound was terrible. Then came the jackhammers.

It was a tired Daniel who walked in to Shay's session the next day. As he prepared us with funny images and random stuff on the web, I knew that I had chosen the right talk for my current state of vegetable mind. I don't mean that Shay’s session was trivial. It was brilliant.

Shay built an application from scratch, using NuGet packages to fill out the blanks. It was nothing less than an excellent demo of the power that comes to those who take a trip to NuGet and fill the cart with already developed tools. In no time at all, Shay created an app that could interpret six languages, export data, format text, extract YouTube videos, etc.

I will not go through all the packages used in the application, but I found the 
Roslyn, Ruby, Python and some JavaScript code runners to be really cool. And
FluentDateTime. And the YouTube video extractor. And ObjectDumper. And Ensure.That.
And...well, [check out the video here]({{page.video}}) and see for yourself.
