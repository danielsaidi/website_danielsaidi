The SwiftUI `ScrollView` is currently quite limited in functionality, and will for instance not let us detect the current scroll offset. Let's take s look at how to add offset tracking to it.

{% include kankoda/data/open-source.html name="ScrollKit" %}


## How to track scroll offset

To add scroll offset tracking to a scroll view, we must first define a `coordinate space` that we'll use to read the frame of the scroll view content:

```swift
enum ScrollOffsetNamespace {

    static let namespace = "scrollView"
}
```

We must then define a `preference key` that we can use to track the scroll offset, by adding a `preference` modifier to the scroll view content:

```swift
struct ScrollOffsetPreferenceKey: PreferenceKey {

    static var defaultValue: CGPoint = .zero

    static func reduce(value: inout CGPoint, nextValue: () -> CGPoint) {}
}
```

We can now use these types to create a view that can detect the offset when it's added to a scroll view:

```swift
struct ScrollViewOffsetTracker: View {

    var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { geo in
            Color.clear
                .preference(
                    key: ScrollOffsetPreferenceKey.self,
                    value: geo
                        .frame(in: .named(ScrollOffsetNamespace.namespace))
                        .origin
                )
        }
        .frame(height: 0)
    }
}
```

This view just applies a `preference` with the preference key and namespace to a `Color`, then wraps the color in a `GeometryReader` that is used to get the frame of the view. 

To make sure that this view doesn't conflict with the `ScrollView` content, we also apply a zero height `frame` to the geometry reader.

For this to work, we must add a `coordinateSpace` to the scroll view and track preference changes to the `ScrollOffsetPreferenceKey`. We can define this as a `ScrollView` extension:

```swift
private extension ScrollView {

    func withOffsetTracking(
        action: @escaping (_ offset: CGPoint) -> Void
    ) -> some View {
        self.coordinateSpace(name: ScrollOffsetNamespace.namespace)
            .onPreferenceChange(ScrollOffsetPreferenceKey.self, perform: action)
    }
}
```

We can now put things together by using the offset tracking view and the scroll extension:

```swift
ScrollView(.vertical) {
    ZStack(alignment: .top) {
        ScrollViewOffsetTracker()
        // Insert scroll view content here
    }
}
.withOffsetTracking(action: { print("Offset: \($0)") })
```

The offset is now continuously sent to the action as the scroll view is scrolled. You can use this to fade out content in the header, present additional views, etc.


## Creating a new scroll view component

Since you must always use a `ZStack` with `.top` alignment, an offset tracker view and a view modifier, I found it easier and less error-prone to create a separate scroll view:

```swift
public struct ScrollViewWithOffset<Content: View>: View {

    public init(
        _ axes: Axis.Set = .vertical,
        showsIndicators: Bool = true,
        onScroll: ScrollAction? = nil,
        @ViewBuilder content: @escaping () -> Content
    ) {
        self.axes = axes
        self.showsIndicators = showsIndicators
        self.onScroll = onScroll ?? { _ in }
        self.content = content
    }

    private let axes: Axis.Set
    private let showsIndicators: Bool
    private let onScroll: ScrollAction
    private let content: () -> Content

    public typealias ScrollAction = (_ offset: CGPoint) -> Void

    public var body: some View {
        ScrollView(axes, showsIndicators: showsIndicators) {
            ZStack(alignment: .top) {
                ScrollViewOffsetTracker()
                content()
            }
        }.withOffsetTracking(action: onScroll)
    }
}
```

You can then just use `ScrollViewWithOffset` instead of having to specify all required components every time you want to use offset tracking:

```swift
struct MyView: View {

    @State
    private var scrollOffset: CGPoint = .zero
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            ScrollViewWithOffset(onScroll: handleScroll) {
                LazyVStack {
                    ForEach(1...100, id: \.self) {
                        Divider()
                        Text("\($0)").frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                    }
                }
            }.navigationTitle(offsetTitle)
        }
    }

    func handleScroll(_ offset: CGPoint) {
        self.scrollOffset = offset
    }
}
```

Scrolling the scroll view will continuously update the `scrollOffset` state property, which we present in the navigation title. This will initially look like this:

![A screenshot of an app where offset is zero]({{page.assets}}scroll-init.png){:width="300"}

As you then scroll the content in the scroll view, the `scrollOffset` state property will be updated and the new value rendered in the navigation bar title:

![A screenshot of an app where scroll offset is not zero]({{page.assets}}scroll-scrolled.png){:width="300"}

That's basically it. You now have a `ScrollView` replacement that let's you define an action that provides you with the scroll offset, which you can use in many exciting ways.


## Binding vs action

If you have seen similar code and wonder why I use an action instead of a binding, I find using a binding confusing when it's not possible to change the value to scroll to an offset.

Since the binding is thus in fact read-only and writing to it would lead to bugs, I decided use an action instead, and provide it with the scroll offset.

Since iOS 18 will now add the possibiliy to scroll to a certain offset, I may change this code to use a binding.


## Conclusion

`ScrollViewWithOffset` replaces `ScrollView` and lets you track scroll offset by providing it with an additional `onScroll` action. 

I have added `ScrollViewWithOffset` to my newly released [ScrollKit]({{project.url}}) library. You can find the source code [here]({{project.url}}{{page.source}}). If you give it a try, I'd love to hear what you think.

Big thanks to [Daniel Arden]({{page.arden}}) for providing me with this nice offset tracking and for joining my efforts to build a fun scroll view feature that we'll uncover in the next post. Stay tuned!
