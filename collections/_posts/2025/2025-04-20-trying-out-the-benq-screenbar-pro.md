I've had the pleasure of receiving a ScreenBar Pro from [Benq]({{page.benq}}) to compare how much better it is than my current desktop setup. I will give it a try and share my experience here.

Unboxing and installing the ScreenBar Pro was very straightforward. The box contains the lightbar, a wall plug adapter for USB-C, and an optional webcam accessory to stick on top of the ScreenBar.

So I just had to fix the ScreenBar on top of my 27" LG Ultrafine monitor and plug in the cable, and I was good to go. I will probably plug it into the monitor later, but for now went with the wall socket.

I mostly work in a brightly lit office, even late in the evening. If I ever kill the light, I have a desk lamp mounted to a shelf in the upper left corner, which causes some uneven lighting:

In comparison, the ScreenBar Pro gives very smooth and even illumination, even in this dark room:

Switching to the ScreenBar Pro was a bit awkward at first, since it's so bright. But the easy to access brightness and color balance controls make it really easy to adjust it to your setting.

Something I really like with the ScreenBar Pro is its Presence Detection and Auto-Dimming features.

The Presence Detection makes the ScreenBar Pro automatically light up when you sit down to work, and automatically turns it off as you leave, and Auto-Dimming monitors the ambient light condition and dynamically adjust the brightness.

Overall, I find the build quality of the ScreenBar Pro to be really nice, and it fits my LG monitor well. While I found the lighting a bit awkward at first, I quickly got used to it and miss it when I turn it off.

I will give the ScreenBar Pro a thorough run over a few of weeks, and will update this post if I have any more insights or conclusions while using it. If you want to check it out, you can grab one [here]({{page.eshop}}).
