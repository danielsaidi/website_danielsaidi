Shaitan, from deep within the sands
Erupting through the dunes
Shaitan, burning through these lands
Igniting the ancient sun

To find the stones that hold him
To break the locks that fetter him
To stir his mind and wake him up
To torch this world with his return

Shaitan, born within the earth
Children of the idol enslaved
Shaitan, unleashers of the king
Breakers of the ancient chains

You found the stones that held him
You broke the locks that fettered him
You stirred his mind and woke him up
Youâ€™ll torch this world with his return

Shaitan, your lord
Shaitan, your king
Shaitan, through flames his reign will begin
Shaitan, his rise
Shaitan, their fall
Shaitan, unleash him and conquer it all

Shai-tan

Shaitan, your lord has returned
Ashes all that remains
Shaitan, your enemies burn
Under the erupting sun

You broke the stones that held him
You shattered the locks that fettered him
You stirred his mind and woke him up
You torch this world with his return

Shaitan, your lord
Shaitan, your king
Shaitan, through flames his reign will begin
Shaitan, his rise
Shaitan, their fall
Shaitan, unleash him and conquer it all

Shai-tan
