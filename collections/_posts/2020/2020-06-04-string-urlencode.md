In this post, we'll look at how to url encode strings. We'll then create an extension that let's us do this easier and with less code.


## The basics

As far as I know, Swift has no great, native way to url encode strings. We can come a bit on our way by using `addingPercentEncoding`:

```swift
let string = "Hello, world & beyond!"
string.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlPathAllowed)
// => "Hello,%20world%20&%20beyond!"
```

However, this will not perform a complete encoding. If the string contains `&` for instance, that character will remain unchanged and mess up things if the string should be used as query parameters.

To solve this, we need to replace all `&` with their url encoded form, `%26`:

```swift
string.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlPathAllowed)
    .replacingOccurrences(of: "&", with: "%26")
// => "Hello,%20world%20%26%20beyond!"
```

This is better, but I think you see where I am going with this. We can't do this every time we want to url encode a string. We can do better.


## Extending String

Let's create a `String` extension to help us perform url encoding better:

```swift
public extension String {
    
    func urlEncoded() -> String? {
        addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlPathAllowed)?
            .replacingOccurrences(of: "&", with: "%26")
    }
}
```

We can now perform url encoding in a much more compact and readable way:

```swift
string.urlEncoded()
// => "Hello,%20world%20%26%20beyond!"
```

I think this is a lot cleaner. It's also less error-prone, since we don't repeat the same logic over and over in our codebase. Also, if we realize that another character is also not properly handled, we just have to change this single extension.


## Source code

I have added this extension to my [SwiftKit]({{page.lib}}) library. You can find the source code [here]({{page.source}}). Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think!
