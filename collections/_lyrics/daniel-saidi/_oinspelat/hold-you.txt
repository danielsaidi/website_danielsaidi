Hold you


I remember you then, as a friend
when the future hadn't happened (yet)
As those days
Wasted away
The future was rich and far away

What's happened since then?
Would you still call yourself my friend?

I remember you now
With or without
How the future was rushing by

So long ago
That future is so long ago

I will hold you when you're up
I will hold you when you're down
I will hold you through each day
I will never walk away

And when you're on your final breath
I will hold through what's left
I will hold you through each day
I will never walk away

(Ngt break)

What's happened since then?
Would you still call yourself my friend?


I will hold you when you're up
I will hold you when you're down
I will hold you through each day
I will never walk away

And when you're on your final breath
I will hold through what's left
I will hold you through each day
I will never walk away
