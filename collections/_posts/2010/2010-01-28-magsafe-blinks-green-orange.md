I have some strange updates regarding the greeen/orange blinking MagSafe I wrote
about yesterday, where the LED on the MagSafe toggles green/orange, even when the
battery is fully loaded.

The battery worked great in a friend's computer, and her MagSafe worked great in
my MacBook! Yet, when I came home, the blinking re-appeared and continues with
another MagSafe connector as well.

Strange times indeed, and they became even stranger.

Before going to bed yesterday (after reading about blinking and exploding MagSafe
connectors for hours) I decided to install OS X upgrades. The upgrade notes said
something about adjusting the computer for new hardware (strange) and then I shut
it down for the night.

When I then started the computer this morning, the MagSafe no longer blinked! It
actually seems to work! Either, my MagSafe connector is faulty and the other one
I tried is broken as well (unlikely), or I just needed additional battery drivers. 
I don't understand this, but as long as it's fixed, I'm happy.

**Update** At 10:30 am, the MagSafe started blinking again. It seems like it doesn't
blink when I've had it disconnected for a while, which could be because the battery
needs some extra charging, which takes a while. Since my neighbors's MagSafe blinked
with my computer and the battery is now replaced, the only thing that's left is the
computer...most probably the motherboard.
