I gave this talk at [{{page.location}}]({{page.location-url}}) in October 2025, on best practices in SDK development, and how to create a great developer experience, both for your users and yourself.


## Abstract

Modern software increasingly relies on open-source and commercial, closed-source libraries, yet creating a maintainable, developer-friendly SDK remains a challenge.

This talk delves into best practices that differentiate great SDKs from good ones, and explores many critical aspects of SDK development.

We'll look at how to design intuitive APIs and structure the API surface for discoverability, and how to create a system design that scales over time, with tests that ensure SDK and API reliability.

We'll also touch on building documentation that serves your users' needs, how to implement robust versioning strategies with semanting versioning, and how to use deprecations to manage changes. 

Whether you're maintaining an existing SDK or planning a new one, you'll walk away with insights to create SDKs that developers trust and enjoy using.
