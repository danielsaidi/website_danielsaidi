## Work

I joined Voyado as Head of Mobile, to develop a mobile strategy for the company and to implement mobile utilities and application. 

During my time there, I developed a mobile client api as well as apps that used the api to connect to the Voyado platform. One such app was an iOS and Android app for a Swedish restaurant chain, that was used to push user-specific offers, let users navigate to the nearest restaurant etc.

After a year at Voyado, the company decided to focus on the core platform and web apis and leave mobile integrations to each client. I then decided to leave Voyado to join [BookBeat]({{page.bookbeat}}) as Mobile Lead.


## Technologies

The mobile api was created in .NET and C# and provided functionality like mobile offers, authentication, SMS integrations etc. It has evolved since I left and to my knowledge is still used for mobile integrations.

The mobile apps were based on [Ionic Framework]({{page.ionic}}), which I really liked developing in. I created a Voyado-specific layer that could be reused by each new app, much like a mobile SDK.
