You may have noticed that this blog has been a bit silent lately. One of many reasons is that I've had to focus on many new KeyboardKit customers and with the upcoming KeyboardKit 10 release.

## KeyboardKit

I started working on KeyboardKit almost ten years ago. Since then, what started as a small project has evolved into a product that is used by hundred of apps and big companies that use it to build amazing things.

KeyboardKit is used in AI-powered keyboards, keyboards that protect children from malicious web activities, and keyboards that can help detecting and preventing bipolarity and other mental health issues. It helps people write in 75+ languages and lets developer build tools for their communities. 

I'm so proud to play a small part in all these amazing products and services, which is why I want the KeyboardKit SDK to be the very best tool there is for keyboard-related products.


## KeyboardKit 10

KeyboardKit 10 is a huge step forward for KeyboardKit as an SDK and product. It will merge the two SDKs into a single. unified SDK and clean up and improve many parts of the library. 

This will make future development much easier and provide a more cohesive developer experience to everyone who use the KeyboardKit SDK in their product.

The [KeyboardKit 10 Developer Preview]({{page.post}}) was annouced today, and lets developer test the next major version before the upcoming beta releases and final release later in September. See the blog post for a lot of important information regarding this release.

Big thanks to everyone who are part of the KeyboardKit project - I truly love doing this together with all of you, and look forward to an exciting future!
