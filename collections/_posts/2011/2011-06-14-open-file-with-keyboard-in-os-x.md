Although I love OS X, I am still new to it and a Windows user by habit. As such,
the unintuitive and secret clubesque keyboard shortcuts are not one of my most
favorite parts with using OS X.

For instance, it took me a year to discover that I could press space to preview
files in Finder, with the preview software being one of the best Iâ€™ve ever used.
Why so obscure, Apple?

My latest finding is how to open files. Being a Windows user, I have been pressing
the return key SO many times, which means OPEN in Windows, but RENAME in OS X.

So, I have been double-clicking files every time I have wanted to open them. Today,
though, I finally found that instead of hitting return, I can use `cmd + down` instead.

This changes everything.
