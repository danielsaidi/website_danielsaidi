In this post, we'll look at how to read from and write to the keychain on iOS devices. We'll look at a great library for this and how we can make it more abstract.


## The basics

The device keychain can be used to small amounts of data outside of our applications. This lets data stick around even if users reinstall our application. The data can also be backed up and restored by encrypted backups.

However, working with the keychain is not very convenient. Therefore, the [SwiftKeychainWrapper]({{page.repo}}) project is nice, since it lets us use the keychain like `UserDefaults`.

This project is well written, but not maintained. To not depend on an outdated repository and avoid external dependencies, I have added the source code to my [SwiftKit]({{page.lib}}) library and migrated it to the latest Swift version. You can find the source code [here]({{page.source}}).

Although you shouldn't overuse the keychain, it can be a lifesaver in certain situations, where data must be around even if the application is deleted. Just be careful with how you use it.


## Making it abstract

To avoid having to depend on the library's `KeychainWrapper`, I have created a couple of protocols that lets us better control how the keychain is used.

To read from the keychain, I use a `KeychainReader` protocol:

```swift
public protocol KeychainReader: AnyObject {

    func accessibility(for key: String) -> KeychainItemAccessibility?
    func bool(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool?
    func data(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Data?
    func dataRef(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Data?
    func double(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Double?
    func float(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Float?
    func hasValue(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool
    func integer(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Int?
    func object(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> NSCoding?
    func string(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> String?
}
```

and to write to the keychain, I use a `KeychainWriter` protocol:

```swift
public protocol KeychainWriter: AnyObject {

    @discardableResult
    func removeObject(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool
    
    @discardableResult
    func removeAllKeys() -> Bool
    
    @discardableResult
    func set(_ value: Bool, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool
    
    @discardableResult
    func set(_ value: Data, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool
    
    @discardableResult
    func set(_ value: Double, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool
    
    @discardableResult
    func set(_ value: Float, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool
    
    @discardableResult
    func set(_ value: Int, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool
    
    @discardableResult
    func set(_ value: NSCoding, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool
    
    @discardableResult
    func set(_ value: String, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool
}
```

I then have a `KeychainService` that implements these protocols (like how `Codable` implements `Encodable` and `Decodable`):

```swift
public protocol KeychainService: KeychainReader, KeychainWriter {}
```

I then have a standard `KeychainService` implementation that just wraps the `KeychainWrapper`:

```swift
public class StandardKeychainService: KeychainService {
    
    public init(wrapper: KeychainWrapper = .standard) {
        self.wrapper = wrapper
    }
    
    private let wrapper: KeychainWrapper
}

extension StandardKeychainService: KeychainReader {
    
    public func accessibility(for key: String) -> KeychainItemAccessibility? {
        wrapper.accessibility(for: key)
    }
    
    public func bool(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool? {
        wrapper.bool(for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    public func data(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Data? {
        wrapper.data(for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    public func dataRef(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Data? {
        wrapper.dataRef(for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    public func double(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Double? {
        wrapper.double(for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    public func float(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Float? {
        wrapper.float(for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    public func hasValue(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool {
        wrapper.hasValue(for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    public func integer(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Int? {
        wrapper.integer(for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    public func object(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> NSCoding? {
        wrapper.object(for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    public func string(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> String? {
        wrapper.string(for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
}

extension StandardKeychainService: KeychainWriter {
    
    @discardableResult
    public func removeObject(for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool {
        wrapper.removeObject(for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    public func removeAllKeys() -> Bool {
        wrapper.removeAllKeys()
    }
    
    @discardableResult
    public func set(_ value: Bool, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool {
        wrapper.set(value, for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    @discardableResult
    public func set(_ value: Data, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool {
        wrapper.set(value, for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    @discardableResult
    public func set(_ value: Double, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool {
        wrapper.set(value, for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    @discardableResult
    public func set(_ value: Float, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool {
        wrapper.set(value, for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    @discardableResult
    public func set(_ value: Int, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool {
        wrapper.set(value, for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    @discardableResult
    public func set(_ value: NSCoding, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool {
        wrapper.set(value, for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
    
    @discardableResult
    public func set(_ value: String, for key: String, with accessibility: KeychainItemAccessibility?) -> Bool {
        wrapper.set(value, for: key, with: accessibility)
    }
}
```

Wrapping a wrapper may seem a bit too much, but it's to separate the protocols from the keychain and allow the wrapper to change without having to change the public protocols.


## Source code

I have added these extensions to my [SwiftKit]({{page.lib}}) library. You can find the source code [here]({{page.source}}). Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think!
