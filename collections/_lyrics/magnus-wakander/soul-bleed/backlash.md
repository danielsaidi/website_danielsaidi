You are marching
To a battle where your end will begin
You’re at war with
An enemy over who you’ll never win
You last dawn in
This world before they drag you in
You lived calmly
Until this backlash hit you from within

Now it’s too late
This is your fate
This is pure hate
This is a backlash 
That you never did expect

You are falling
One by one, together, everywhere
They are calling
For you intrails, blood and skin to wear
They’re appalling
But nature does not seem to care
Here the strong wins
Now this backlash hits you from within

Now it’s too late
This is your fate
This is pure hate
This is a backlash 
That you never did expect

They are carving
New laws and stories in your skin
You’re adorning
Your old buildings with your broken limbs
A new dawn in
An old world, once more reborn in sin
They came from nowhere
A backlash that hit you from within

This hits you from within
This hits you from within
This eats you from within
This eats you from within

It is too late
This is your fate
This is pure hate
This is a backlash 
That you never did expect
