I gave this workshop at [{{page.location}}]({{page.location_url}}) in 2021, on how to build a video streaming app for tvOS with SwiftUI, including designing grids & shelves, implementing pagination, etc.


## Abstract

In this workshop, we'll look at how to build a video streaming app for tvOS with SwiftUI. We'll create an app that lists movies in shelves & grids and a movie screen that lets us watch the movie.

We'll also look at common features like trailer support, marking the movie as a favorite, and look at current SwiftUI performance problems on tvOS and how to work around them.

  # API
  
  OMDb - http://omdbapi.com
  
  Very easy to integrate with
  
  But lacks important information
  
  Therefore, a pretty basic app
  
  Simplicity to focus on SwiftUI
</section>

  Discover - List movies by year
  
  Favorites - List favorite movies

  Various glitches, e.g. text field
  
  Styling, e.g. buttons and text fields
  
  Missing components, e.g. search field
  
  Focus engine behavior
  
  Bad performance in stacks and grids
