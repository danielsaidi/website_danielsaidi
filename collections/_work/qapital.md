I joined Qapital as a freelance mobile engineer in 2022, where I implemented the company design system in SwiftUI and built new features in one of the feature teams.

I also led the architectural work on moving away from project-nested frameworks in a large and slow to build project, to a modular, Swift Package-based architecture.

This helped speed up development by shortening the feedback loop, and made it possible to use modern tools, like SwiftUI previews.
