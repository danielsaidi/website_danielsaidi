Put a smile on my face
======================


Put a smile on my face
Before you leave this place
Put a smile on my face
So I know that you'll be alright
Before you leave this place
Leave this place

The sun is up
The day is bright
But you my love
Is out of sight

My heart is where the ocean is
Meet me there, meet me there

I heard you call
The other day
Something about
That grand escape

We used to dream
About that leave
Over the ocean wide
The ocean wide

Put a smile on my face
When you leave this place
Put a smile on my face
So I know that you'll be alright
When you leave this place
Leave this place

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When you don't want to
I know it's hard to be a part of it all
When you don't want to
When you don't want to

Put a smile on my face
Go on, leave this place
Put a smile on my face
And leave this place
Leave this place
