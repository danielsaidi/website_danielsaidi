Oribi develops powerful spelling aids and other types of language support for the digital and physical world, including word prediction, spell checking, voice synthesizing and more.

The first product I developed for Oribi was [oKeyboard]({{page.okeyboard}}), which is a custom keyboard for iOS and iPadOS. It builds on [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) and adds features like autocomplete, spellchecking, text-to-speech etc.

As part of oKeyboard, I structured Oribi's various tools into separate libraries, which makes it easy to combine them in apps that use Oribi technologies.

The second project was to upgrade their text editor for iPad - OribiWriter - to a document-based app that is written in Swift and SwiftUI and supports iOS, iPadOS and macOS.

Thanks to Oribi, [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) has evolved a lot as part of making oKeyboard great. Big thanks to Oribi for sponsporing [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}})!
