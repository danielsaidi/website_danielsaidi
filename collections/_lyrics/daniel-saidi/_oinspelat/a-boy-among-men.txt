A boy among men


I could never make it right
How hard I even tried
Of all the good things that I've done
I've always had help
Always had help

I know nothing of the things
That you need
Can hardly use a single tool
Don't know how to make money grow
A business thrive
Keep a family safe

I have tried
Always failed
I don't know what's left

I'm just a boy among men
