## Work

I joined BookBeat as iOS Lead in 2016, shortly after the first public iOS release. During my time there, BookBeat went from 4 to 28 markets and reached almost 500.000 monthly users.

As iOS and Mobile Architecture Lead, I evolved the iOS app from a single app monolith to a distributed mobile system that consisted of several feature-specific libraries . This architecture made it possible to develop apps for iOS (with Car Play support), watchOS and tvOS, with no business logic in the apps.

The apps are written in Swift and uses SwiftUI where possible (it supports iOS 11, so it must support UIKit as well). The apps share business logic through a set of shared, well-tested libraries, that provides shared business models, network logic, offline support etc.

BookBeat was the first Swedish autobook service to get support for CarPlay and watchOS, and the first streaming audio service to get support for downloading files directly on the watch.

At BookBeat, I had the opportunity to focus on accessibility, taking help from Swedish agencies. The app has support for dark mode, voice over, high contrast colors, dynamic type and more.
