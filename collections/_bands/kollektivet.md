I started Kollektivet in 2001, after writing Swedish songs for many years. The first lineup was just me and a guitarist, trying out songs with no recorded result.

The subsequent lineups recorded several demos with a solid core, and alternating members. It was a great time and I am fortunate to have shared it with all the wonderful people involved.
