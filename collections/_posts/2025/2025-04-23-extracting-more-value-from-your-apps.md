Many apps have untapped commercial potential, where sophisticated features that can help others are isolated to that single app, with commercial success at the grace of the App Store and its users.

I'm thrilled to be giving two talks on the topic of distributing software with Swift Package Manager:

* May 5 at [Luni, Paris]({{page.luni}}): Building SDKs with the Swift Package Manager
* May 14 at [iOSKonf]({{page.ioskonf}}): Distribute & Monetize Closed-Source SDKs with the Swift Package Manager

Both talks focus on leveraging Apple's Swift Package Manager to distribute both open-source and closed-source, but from different angles. The Luni talk will center on SDK best practices, while the iOSKonf talk will dive deeper into the technical aspects of creating packages and many important strategies for monetizing closed-source software.

Many companies are sitting on additional value hidden inside their apps. What if the technology that powers your app could be packaged and sold as a separate product? With the right protection and licensing, you can unlock additional revenue streams from your existing, valuable technology.

For example, have you invested significant time, effort, and R&D into building a feature or a piece of technology for your app, that’s not critical to your app’s core business, but that could solve common problems for others? If so, that might be the perfect candidate to extract into a standalone product and monetize with commercial licensing.

Feel free to reach out if you're curious about how to extract more value from your app, or want to explore monetization opportunities across your software stack. I offer company talks on this subject and can help you implement a closed-source SDK with proper licensing and payment strategies.
