In this post, we'll take a look at how to customize the macOS About Panel in SwiftUI, by using project settings, bundle files, and SwiftUI-specific tools.

For more information about customizing the macOS menu bar, I have also written a post about [how to customize the macOS menu bar in SwiftUI]({{page.post}}).


## Background

As an example, let's create a brand new SwiftUI app and call it "MyApp". When running the app, the main menu will have a default "About..." item that opens the app's about panel:

![The default about panel]({{page.assets}}/default.png)

This panel will by default show the app icon, name, build number and version number. If we add an app icon to our app, it will automatically be applied without any code needed.

There are however things that we may want to adjust. For instance, the display name should be "My App", not "MyApp". We may also want to display additional information, like copyright.


## How to customize the app display name

The project name "MyApp" is the default display name for the app. Let's change the display name to "My App" in Project Settings to see what happens.

We can either do this under the "Info" tab:

![A screenshot of how to change display name in Info]({{page.assets}}/displayname-1.png)

or in Build Settings:

![A screenshot of how to change display name in Info]({{page.assets}}/displayname-2.png)

If we run the app with this new display name, the main menu and about panel will still say "MyApp", while the menu item that opens the about panel says "About My App". 

![A screenshot of how to change display name in Build Settings]({{page.assets}}/name.png)

So, the main menu and its about panel seem to use the project name and ignore the display name, while the "About My App" menu item seems to use it.

While there may be ways to fix this with settings, let's look at how to customize the About Panel to show custom content, with and without code.


## How to customize the about panel without code

Although I haven't found a way to change the app display name in the about panel without code, there are some things that you *can* change with build settings and files.

### Copyright

Any copyright text that you add in Build Settings automatically appears in the about panel:

![A screenshot of how to change copyright information]({{page.assets}}/copyright.png)

If you add this, the about panel will show the information like this:

![A screenshot of how copyright is presented in the about panel]({{page.assets}}/copyright-panel.png)

### Credits

You can also provide custom credits (credits to [@troz](https://mastodon.social/@troz) and [@casecollection](https://moth.social/@casecollection)) for the app, by adding a `credits.rtf` or `credits.html` file to your app. 

Here, we add an RTF file with some rich text content:

![A screenshot of how to add an RTF file]({{page.assets}}/credits-rtf.png)

If you add this, the about panel will show the information like this:

![A screenshot of how credits are presented in the about panel]({{page.assets}}/credits-rtf-panel.png)

However, if you want the credits to contain dynamic content, you need to define this info with code.



## How to customize the about panel with code

To customize the About Panel with code, we'll use the same techniques as we looked at in [this post]({{page.post}}), on how to customize the main menu commands of an app.

We must replace the default about button with one that calls an `NSApplication` function that's called `orderFrontStandardAboutPanel`, which opens an About Panel with custom options:

```swift
@main
struct MyAppApp: App {
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            CommandGroup(replacing: .appInfo) {
               Button("About My App") {
                    NSApplication.shared
                       .orderFrontStandardAboutPanel(
                            options: [.applicationName: "My App"]
                        )
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code replaces the `.appInfo` menu item with a custom menu item that overrides the app name:

![A custom about panel]({{page.assets}}/custom.png)

We can use these options to override `applicationInfo`, `applicationName` and `applicationVersion`, as well as `credits` and `version` (build number):

![Customization options]({{page.assets}}/intellisense.png)

The version row disappears if you set `applicationVersion` and `version` to empty strings and adjusts itself if you set either value to an empty string.

The `credits` value is presented below the version. Notice that this is an *attributed string*. Your app will actually *crash* if you set it to a plain string:

```swift
@main
struct MyAppApp: App {
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            CommandGroup(replacing: .appInfo) {
               Button("About My App") {
                    NSApplication.shared
                       .orderFrontStandardAboutPanel(
                        options: [
                            .applicationName: "My App",
                            .credits: NSAttributedString(
                                string: "This amazing app was created in SwiftUI.\nCopyright Â©2023. No rights reserved.",
                                attributes: [
                                    .foregroundColor: NSColor.secondaryLabelColor,
                                    .font: NSFont.systemFont(ofSize: NSFont.smallSystemFontSize)
                                ]
                            )
                        ]
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Yikes, I don't like that indentation! Let's specify it in another way to make the code cleaner:

```swift
@main
struct MyAppApp: App {
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            CommandGroup(replacing: .appInfo) {
               Button("About My App") {
                    NSApplication.shared
                       .orderFrontStandardAboutPanel(
                        options: .basic(
                            applicationName: "My App",
                            credits: "..."
                        )
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

public extension Dictionary 
    where Key == NSApplication.AboutPanelOptionKey, Value == Any {
    
    static func basic(
        applicationName: String,
        credits: String
    ) -> Self {
        [
            .applicationName: applicationName,
            .credits: NSAttributedString(
                string: credits,
                attributes: [
                    .foregroundColor: NSColor.secondaryLabelColor,
                    .font: NSFont.systemFont(ofSize: NSFont.smallSystemFontSize)
                ]
            )
        ]
    }
}
```

If we run the app again, we now have custom credits with a custom style in place as well:

![Custom credits]({{page.assets}}/credits.png)

We can improve this further, by creating a command that can be reused in many apps:

```swift
public struct AboutPanelCommand: Commands {
    
    public init(
        title: String,
        applicationName: String = Bundle.main.displayName,
        credits: String? = nil
    ) {
        let options: [NSApplication.AboutPanelOptionKey: Any]
        if let credits {
            options = [
                .applicationName: applicationName,
                .credits: NSAttributedString(
                    string: credits,
                    attributes: [
                        .foregroundColor: NSColor.secondaryLabelColor,
                        .font: NSFont.systemFont(ofSize: NSFont.smallSystemFontSize)
                    ]
                )
            ]
        } else {
            options = [.applicationName: applicationName]
        }
        self.init(title: title, options: options)
    }
    
    public init(
        title: String,
        options: [NSApplication.AboutPanelOptionKey: Any]
    ) {
        self.title = title
        self.options = options
    }
    
    private let title: String
    private let options: [NSApplication.AboutPanelOptionKey: Any]
    
    public var body: some Commands {
        CommandGroup(replacing: .appInfo) {
            Button(title) {
                NSApplication.shared
                    .orderFrontStandardAboutPanel(options: options)
            }
        }
    }
}

public extension Bundle {
    
    var displayName: String {
        infoDictionary?["CFBundleDisplayName"] as? String ?? "-"
    }
}
```

This lets us reduce the amount of code in our app to the following:

```swift
@main
struct MyAppApp: App {
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            AboutPanelCommand(
                title: "About My App",
                credits: "This amazing app was created in SwiftUI...."
            )
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, we use the simplified initializer to define credits as plain text. If we want to specify a custom atttributed string, we have that option as well. 


## Conclusion

While I like SwiftUI's APIs for working with menu commands, the About Panel stuff is a bit hidden. I hope that they bring a more native approach in a future SwiftUI update.

I'd also love to see the limitations of the attributed string capabilities. The first to make Doom run in the credits text field (someone made it run in the touch bar) wins a prize.
