  In this talk, we look at how abstractions and libraries can help you

    # Keeping it together
    ### How do you keep your code base sane?
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Good practices
    * Minimize coupling
    * Minimize inheritance
    * Don't let external dependencies leak
    * Keep it simple!
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Spike & Stabilize
    * Dan North, 2011
    * Good for changing scope, pivots etc.
    * Optimize for throwawayability
    * Code should be easy to throw away
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Prototype-driven
    * Start with a prototype
    * Stabilize if proven valuable
    * Throw away if proven worthless 
    * Code MUST be easy to throw away

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## What is code smell?
    * Surface indication of deeper problems
    * Violate fundamental design principles
    * Usually not bugs, but can hide nasty ones
    * Bad habits, inexperience, stress

    <script type="text/template">
    ## Long-term effects
    * Rigid code, hard to change
    * Untestable code, lack of abstractions
    * Degrades over time

    # So, BookBeat?
    ### How did the code-base look after a year?

  <section data-markdown class="image-section" data-background="{{assets}}/secret.gif">

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Good things first 
    * Build server
    * Fastlane
    * Beta testing
    * Localization
    * AND - They got a business launched
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Code problems
    * Generally overly-complex
    * Rigid code, hard coupling
    * Really hard to break up dependencies
    * **RestKit & CoreData everywhere**
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## AudioPlayer 
    * 1000 lines monolith
    * Plays, streams, buffers, reports etc.
    * Spaghetti code
    * Untested, untestable
    * Depends on database entities
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Project problems
    * Slow build times
    * All logic in the app
    * Existing unit tests disabled
    * Can't add tests (segmentation fault 11)
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## How are we handling it?
    * Baby steps!
    * Break up dependencies
    * Make domain model abstract
    * Extract code into libraries
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## CocoaPods
    * Package Manager for iOS
    * Alternatives: Carthage, Swift PM
    * ✖ CocoaPod repo
    * ✔ Private git repos + Development pods
    </script>
  </section>
  
  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Libraries: pros
    * Can be used in multiple apps
    * Minimizes the app's responsibility
    * Faster build times → easier testing
    * Reduces coupling, forces abstraction
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Libraries: cons
    * Slower app build times (not always)
    * Number of pods can pile up
    * Library versioning hell
    * Sometimes too much complexity
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Current state
    * BookBeat app: 10% less code
    * BBCore (core logic + utils)
    * BBAudioPlayer (audio player)
    * BBDomain (domain model + api)
    * CI & Unit Tests for each project
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Remaining challenges
    * Make domain model 100% abstract
    * Replace RestKit with Alamofire
    * Replace CoreData with Realm
    * Re-enable tests for main app
    </script>

    ## BookBeat-specific
    * No silver bullet
    * Works great for us
    * Pods is not the only way
    * Approach depends on the app
    </script>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
    ## Some advice
    * Abstract - What, not how
    * Get good practices in place early on
    * Reduce coupling (DI)
    * Write tests, at least one test
