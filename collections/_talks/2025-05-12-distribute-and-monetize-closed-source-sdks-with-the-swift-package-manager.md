I gave this talk at [{{page.location}}]({{page.location-url}}), in Skopje, North Macedonia, in May 2025. on how to set up, distribute, and monetize a closed-source SDK with the Swift Package Manager.


## Abstract

Open-source is an amazing way to collaborate with others and share your work with the world, but it's not always the right choice. Certain scenarios demand a closed-source approach.

In this talk, we'll take a look at how to set up, distribute and monetize closed-source software with GitHub and the Swift Package Manager.

We'll also look at how to protect and control access to your software with a commercial license, and will look at how to:

* Set up a dual-repository setup for source code & distribution.
* Implement a private source code package.
* Implement a public distribution package.
* Sell and validate license keys and files.
* Publish publicly hosted documentation without exposing the source code.
* Leverage the Swift Package Manager for distribution.

This talk covers development and business considerations, and offers insights for developers who are looking to commercialize their source code.
