Nothing remains of their shattered bones
When we are done beating
Nothing remains except dust and stones
When we are done eating

Feed your thralls, feed us, feed us more
Your never ending hunger
Drives us on, drives us on, drives us insane, gone
Your hunger is all that remains

You came, we stayed
You called, we obeyed
You fed, we ate
Too much, too late
Too alike, too near
The hunger of Átahsaia is here

Nothing remains of our human form
When we are done eating
Nothing remains except a starving storm
We’ll forever be forever eating

Zuni lord, feed us, feed us more
Your never ending hunger
Haunts us on, haunts us on, drives us insane, gone
Your hunger is all that remains

You came, we stayed
You called, we obeyed
You fed, we ate
Too much, too late
Too alike, too near
The hunger of Átahsaia is here

Your hunger like a spear
Piercing through flesh and mind
Burned breed upon eternal flames
Devouring anything that has a name
Old and young, now only flesh
Digested, nothing left

Starvation your gift
A’doshlě, black masked king
Roasting us upon your flames
Devouring those who still remain
Loyal herd, now only flesh
Digested, nothing left

How could we ever trust this beast
Thinly veiled, thinly veiled as a friend of man
Behind its eyes hides eternal desire
The hunger of lord Átahsaia
Never free, never be, never will
We can eat, we can eat, but will never fill up
The hunger of lord Átahsaia
Is all that we’ll ever feel
