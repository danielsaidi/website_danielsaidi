Abaddon, fallen master
Unleash your doom upon us all
Destruction of this world
Let your maggots once more crawl

Through the flesh of the young
    And the rot of the old
Through the heart of the good
    And the spoils of the bad
Through the soul of the pure
    And the void of the vile
Through the soil and the earth

Abaddon, stirring master
Rise from your depths and come alive
Unleashed into this world
Let your locusts once more fly

Through the lightness of day
    And the blackness of night
Through the fields of crops
    And the deserts of dust
Through the cities of men
    And the ruins of ghosts
Through the core of this earth

Lord Abaddon 
    Your time is near
Lord Abaddon
    Your reign of fear
Lord Abaddon
    We stand to cheer
The Dawn of Abaddon

Lord Abaddon 
    Their fall is near
Lord Abaddon
    Their time to fear
Lord Abaddon
    Kneel in despair
The Rise of Abaddon

Abaddon, risen master
The king of plague and lions' teeth
Ride your wicked horses
Let your carrion once more eat

Through the armies of man
    And the piles of the dead
Through the ones that remains
    And the ones that failed
Through the skies above
    And the chasms below
Through the core of this realm

Lord Abaddon
    Your time is here 
Lord Abaddon
    Your reign of fear
Lord Abaddon 
    We stand to cheer
The Reign of Abaddon

Lord Abaddon
    Their fall is here
Lord Abaddon
    Their time to fear
Lord Abaddon
    Die in despair
The Doom of Abaddon
