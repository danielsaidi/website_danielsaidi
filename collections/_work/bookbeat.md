I joined BookBeat as iOS Lead in 2016, shortly after the first public iOS release. During my time there, BookBeat went from 4 to 28 markets and reached almost 500.000 monthly users.

As iOS and Mobile Architecture Lead, I took the iOS app from a single-target monolith to a distributed, package-based system. This made it possible to develop apps for iOS (with Car Play support), watchOS and tvOS, with no business logic in the apps.

The apps are written in Swift and started migrating from UIKit to SwiftUI when SwiftUI launched in 2019. It was the first regional audioobook service to support CarPlay and watchOS, and the first audio service to get support for downloading files directly on the watch.

At BookBeat, I had the opportunity to take help from external Swedish agencies to focus on accessibility. The app has support for dark mode, voice over, high contrast colors, dynamic type and more.
