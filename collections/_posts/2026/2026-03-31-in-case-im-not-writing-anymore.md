If I haven't written for a while, something may have happened. It could be an accident or something else, so here are some final words in case they're needed.

When I was about to undergo surgery a few years ago, I started thinking about the tiny risk involved with both surgery and anaesthesia, and how to handle if something unexpected happens.

I therefore setup a GitHub action to republish my site on a daily basis, both to let me prepare future content, but also to be able to prepare a post like this. Writing my final words on a blog is perhaps a bit pretentious, but hey - let's call it being prepared!


## Life

Most of you who read this post are probably here for the tech. I'd be amazed if not, since that's the main purpose of this website. However, there are some other aspects of life that I'd love to take up.

To my family - Johanna, Cornelia and Lovisa - I can't express in words how much I love you and what you mean to me. I love you to the stars and back. The same to my mom and dad - Ingrid and Sasan, my brothers Sebastian and Patrick, my niece Julia and my extended family: Gunvor and Sture, Karin, Lars, Theo and Rasmus, Berit, Sören and Lilian, and Kjell - love you all!


## Music

Besides tech, let me plug some [music]({{page.music}}). If this is published, I hope that I finally managed to upload it all to YouTube. If so, spread the word and let this dead guy be at least as famous as Mozart.

Thanks to [Misfortune]({{page.bands}}misfortune) for being my first musical family, which I with my teeenage manners perhaps didn't always deserve. Thanks to [New Wave Stoner / x:o / sgt. Black]({{page.bands}}sgt-black) for being my new family in our new home town. And thanks everyone in to [Kollektivet]({{page.bands}}kollektivet) for bringing life into my C G Am F songs, and for humoring my song-writing ambitions.



## Open-source

I hope that the Swift community takes good care of my various [GitHub repositories]({{page.github}}), if they're still needed. Fork them if you want, and make them remain well-behaved parts of the Swift community.


## Closed-Source

KeyboardKit Pro customers on the Business+ plan can reach out to their Software Escrow agent to ask them to release the source code, so that you can keep your product functional.


## Conclusion

With that said, I hope that this never goes live. If it does, it's been nice to have you as a reader. Sorry for the somewhat morbid tone in this post. I guess it comes with growing up in the ironic 90's. I'll try to be better in my next life.

Love

Daniel Saidi
