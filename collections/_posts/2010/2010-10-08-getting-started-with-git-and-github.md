As some of my hobby projects are coming together, I have meant to move them from
Google Code to GitHub for quite some time. Tonight, I decided to give it a try
and say hello to git and GitHub.

I first visited the [Git download page](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/)
and downloaded the latest git release for OS X. Since configuring git involves a
few of steps, I found [this page](http://help.github.com/mac-git-installation/)
really helpful. 

After installing gi, I found myself typing git commands into the Terminal without
really understanding what I was doing. Pull? Fetch? Clone? What the hell is going
on? I guess I have a lot to learn :)

Nevertheless, my projects did eventually end up on GitHub and I now have the
best incentive ever to master git. If I don't, I'll never see my source code again.
