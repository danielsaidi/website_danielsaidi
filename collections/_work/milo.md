Milo Creative a UK-based tech-company that hired me for keyboard-related work and sponsored my [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) open source project to add missing features that they needed.

Since Milo needed support for locales that required keyboard layouts that KeyboardKit didn't support, work had to be put into making the keyboard layout engine more versatile. 

Thanks to Milo Creative, KeyboardKit now has improved support for input sets, keyboard layouts and multiple locales. Big thanks to Milo Creative for sponsporing KeyboardKit!
