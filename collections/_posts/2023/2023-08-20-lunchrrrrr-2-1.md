Lunchrrrrr has been rewritten for iOS 16. It has an updated and cleaner UI, as well as an improved card drag responsiveness.

Although this app was mostly created for fun, it's a well-crafted app that uses a [deck SDK]({{site.deckkit}}) to render the deck of cards and an [API integration layer]({{site.apikit}}) that simplifies integrating with the Yelp API.

When creating this new version, a lot of code could be removed due to new capabilities in the various libraries that the app uses, that have been upgraded since this app was last updated.

The Yelp integration code and models has also been moved from the app to the open-source [ApiKit]({{site.apikit}}) SDK, which made it possible to reduce the amount of code in the app even more.

For more information about Lunchrrrrr, [download the app from the AppStore]({{app.appStoreUrl}}), or checkout the [app page]({{app.url}}) at the [Kankoda]({{site.kankoda}}) website.
