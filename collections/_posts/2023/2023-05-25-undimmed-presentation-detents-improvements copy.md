In early 2022, I wrote an article about how to bring undimmed presentation detents to SwiftUI sheets. Since then, the original code has been improved many times and behaves a lot better than it did then.

I have therefore updated the [original article]({{page.article}}) with new information and code samples. Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think.
