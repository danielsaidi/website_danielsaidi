  I gave this talk in 2014, on how Apple's vision of 3rd party
  iOS apps went from Safari-based experiences to the native apps 
  we have today, due to the launch of the App Store. We also did
  a case study on how, and why, a popular Swedish brand decided
  to replace their native apps with custom-made, hybrid apps that
  wrapped their new responsive web site.
