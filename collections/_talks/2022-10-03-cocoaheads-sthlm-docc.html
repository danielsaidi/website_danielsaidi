abstract: |  
  I gave this talk at CocoaHeads Stockholm in October 2022.
  In it, we look at how to use DocC to build rich documentation with source
  code documentation, media, articles and tutorials and how to automate
  generating documentation for various environments, like the web.

conference-abstract: |
  DocC is a documentation tool from Apple, that lets you generate outstanding and interactive documentation right from your source code. It integrates directly into Xcode and can also be used to generate documentation for the web.

  In this workshop, we’ll use DocC to document a Swift Package. We’ll generate rich documentation from our source code and expand it with images, articles and tutorials. We’ll also look at some scripts for generating documentation for the web, which we’ll host at GitHub Pages.
