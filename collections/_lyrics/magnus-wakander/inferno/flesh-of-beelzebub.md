With my blade drawn out he is coming alive 
With your fear exploding inside, you are trying to hide 
With my senses sharpened I am going to find 
With your last remaining breath you’re going to cry

I’ll slice, I’ll cut, I’ll stab, I’ll peel 
I’ll do anything I can to make you feel 
I’ll connect your soul with the other side 
It’s just a way for him to slip inside 
I’ll craft your flesh to a vessel for gods 
He will enter your void like the darkest of floods 
You’ll grant him life

You’ll bleed, you’ll scream, you’ll beg, you’ll cry 
I’ll do anything with you except to let you die 
I’ll peel your skin off, piece by piece 
It’s just another way for me to let him in 
He’ll erase your essence, scream by scream 
And let your pain remain inside him like an evil dream

Through my blade held high he is coming alive 
With your skin peeled off as a gate he is sliding inside 
Within your flesh exposed to the world he is coming alive 
An evil reborn in this world is now hiding inside

There’s nothing left to do 
There’s nothing left to say 
There’s no reason to pray 
Just accept that this ancient being is growing inside

There’s nothing left to do 
There’s no more skin nor flesh 
Defleshed you are the vessel 
For the essence 
Years of waiting finally over as he’s coming alive

There’s nothing left to do 
There’s only waiting 
for the pain to make him stronger 
He will feed on all the feelings 
that the blade has brought to life in you

Your flesh will heal, you’ll seem alive 
But your body now belongs to the other side 
You’re caught inside, you’ll never die
You’re just a way to feed him as he’ll come alive 
He’ll replace your conscience when it’s time 
for the legions to be gathered for the end of times 
You may seem alone, but you’re just one 
There are many more like you left to come

Flesh of Beelzebub
Flesh of Beelzebub
Flesh of Beelzebub
Flesh of Beelzebub

There’s nothing left to do 
There’s nothing left to say 
There’s no reason to pray 
Just accept that this ancient being is growing inside

There’s nothing left to do 
There’s no more skin nor flesh 
Defleshed you are the vessel 
For the essence 
Years of waiting finally over as he’s coming alive

There’s nothing left to do 
There’s only waiting 
for the pain to make him stronger 
He will feed on all the feelings 
that the blade has brought to life in you

They’ll bleed, they’ll scream, they’ll beg, they’ll cry 
We’ll do anything with them except to let them die 
We’ll peel their skin off, piece by piece 
It’s just another way for us to let him in 
You’re by my side as we dig deep 
Your outside smiling while your inside weeps
Your flesh surrendered to his will
There are many more like to you to open still

They’ll fill the ranks up one by one 
They’ll join us in the carving ’til the war is won 
Their flesh will heal, like your once did 
But their bodies only stand because of things we hid 
They seem like few, but they’re not all 
There are many, many more to come to heed his call
They’ll fill the world up one by one 
Human carving human ’til the war is won
 
When no one’s left to stop this tide 
There’s no reason anymore for his to hide inside

Strip off their skin, deflesh their bones 
It’s time for him to become his own 
No more resistance, it was all in vain 
The only thing that’s left is never-ending pain
We slice, we cut, we stab, we peel 
Defleshing worlds for him to heal 
We craft their bodies to vessel for gods 
For the end to fill the void like the darkest of floods
