The time has finally come to throw Arial and Verdana into the trash (Helvetica
can stay for a while), as Monotype, Linotype and ITC (and others) have teamed
up to develop a really cool service - web fonts!

[webfonts.fonts.com](http://webfonts.fonts.com) lets you use over 7,500 fonts on
your sites. The result isn't images, but markable, search engine friendly text.

To get started, visit [webfonts.fonts.com](http://webfonts.fonts.com/) and register
as a user. You'll then be able to create projects, to which you can add custom
fonts. After that, you can bind the fonts to your CSS elements, classes and id:s
and paste the generated JavaScript into your site's source code.

Web fonts is free up to a certain amount of page hits, but the free account will
not give you access to all fonts. Still, 1.500 fonts is a great service, so make
sure to try it out!
