I use Parallels Desktop to run Windows from a dedicated OS X partition. It works
great overall, but one thing that I have had problems with, is that the mouse scroll
sensitivity is too sensitive in Windows. Let's see how to fix this in Parallels.

The solution was to open the `Virtual Machine > Configure > Mouse & Keyboard`
configuration window and uncheck `Enable smooth scrolling`. Unchecking this 
solved my problems, but I'm not sure if it has unexpected side-effects that will
show up later.

I haven't noticed any side-effects so far, though. If you have the same problems,
it may be worth giving this solution a try.
