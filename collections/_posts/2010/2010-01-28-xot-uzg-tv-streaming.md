I recently picked up my old, black Xbox from the basement, where it has lived in
solitude since I bought my Nintendo Wii. Since it is *old* and much has happened
with the video game indistry since it came out, I don't game on my XBOX anymore. 
Let's look at some media server fun you can have with it instead.

I love my old Xbox, and had a friend chip it a while back, to be able to install
additional software on it. Up until now, I've used Xbox MediaCenter, but after I
upgraded XBMC to the latest version, a friend told me about `XOT-Uzg`, which is a
script that can be used to stream web TV.

After installing it, I noticed how the wonders of the new world appeared before me,
as `XOT-Uzg` let me stream TV shows from all over the world. Now, my 1 year old
daugher is watching "In the Night Garden", streaming from SVT Play on the XBOX. It's
so smooth! If you can, do try it out!

The only problems I have detected so far are:

* You can not pause for too long, or XOT-Uzg loses its connection.
* You can not skip forward/back or fast-forward/backward.

Also, of course, make sure to pay for the TV services that you decide to watch. This
is just a way to get the content to your Xbox.
