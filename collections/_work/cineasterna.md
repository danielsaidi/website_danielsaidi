Cineasterna is a Swedish streaming video with content from public libraries. Users can loan movies for free with their public library card.

I developed the Cineasterna app for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, as a complement to their web-based app. The apps are written in Swift and SwiftUI and makes use of the latest technologies.

The app lets users browse movies in shelves and grids and explore the total movie stock through filters and search. Users can manage their favorites, switch libraries and loan/watch any movie they like.

The app syncs data between devices and remembers movie position (locally only) when a user resumes a previous watch. The iOS app for iPhone and iPad also supports AirPlay and Chromecast.
