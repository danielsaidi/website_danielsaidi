I use Parallels Desktop to run Windows from a dedicated OS X partition. It works great, but I have had problems with the mouse scroll being too sensitive. Let's see how to fix it.

The solution is to open the `Virtual Machine > Configure > Mouse & Keyboard` window and uncheck `Enable smooth scrolling`. I haven't noticed any side-effects so far, so it seems to be working. Scrolling is now working as expected. 

If you have the same problems with scrolling in Parallels Desktop, it may be worth trying.
