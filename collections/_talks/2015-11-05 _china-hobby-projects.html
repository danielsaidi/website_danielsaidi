  I gave this talk to a Chinese group of college board representatives. I talked about
  how hobby projects can bring happiness, friendship and creativity and how  amazing I
  think it is to create things together with others, be it music, fanzines  or apps. I
  then talked about some collaborative projects, where my family worked with family
  members in San Francisco, that we had never met before, to make apps for children.
