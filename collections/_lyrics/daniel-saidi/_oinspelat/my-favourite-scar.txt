My Favorite Scar
================

Can you see it,
the traceless shape I'm in?
Write stories in my skin
Bring meaning, beat it in

You've got to hit me in the right way,
break some ribs 'til I like it
Cut me, leave a mark -
a favorite scar

Can you feel it,
the sensation in my skin?
We're in the fire, we're in the fire
We're in the fire, we are the fire 

You've got to hit me in the right way
bust some teeth 'til I like it
Burn me, leave a mark
A favorite scar
