{% include kankoda/data/open-source name="TagKit" %}
As I'm rewriting an old app from scratch, I'm adding content tagging to it. For reusability, I've put all tag-specific logic in a new library called [TagKit]({{project.url}}). Let's take a look!

![TagKit logotype]({{page.image}})


## How to slugify strings

One common way to handle tags is to slugify their names, which is removing unsupported characters from a string and replacing any whitespaces with a separator.

You can see slugified strings in many web urls (for instance this one), where the page date and title is often slugified to create a unique valid url that also describes the content.

I wrote about slugifying strings [in this blog post]({{page.slug-post}}) earlier this year. I use this logic in [TagKit]({{project.url}}), but made it a little more configurable when creating it as a reusable package.

In TagKit, the ``Slugifiable`` protocol describes a slugifyable type:

```swift
public protocol Slugifiable {

    var slugifiableValue: String { get }
}
```

`String` implements this protocol by default, by returning itself as the slugifiable value.

Once a type implements ``Slugifiable``, it can be slugified with the `slugified()` function:

```swift
let string = "Hello, world!"
let slug = string.slugified() // Returns "hello-world"
```

You can also provide a custom ``SlugConfiguration`` to customize the slugified result:

```swift
let string = "Hello, world!"
let config = SlugConfiguration(
    separator: "+",
    allowedCharacters: NSCharacterSet(charactersIn: "hewo")
)
let slug = string.slugified(configuration: config) // Returns "he+wo"
```

You probably won't need to use these functions directly, nor customize the configuration, but you can if you want or need to.


### Taggable types

With slugification in place, let's implement tagging, which can be used to group, filter, etc.

In TagKit, the ``Taggable`` protocol describes a taggable type:

```swift
public protocol Taggable {

    var tags: [String] { get set }
}
```

Once a type implements ``Taggable``, it can use all the functionality the protocol provides, such as `hasTags`, `hasTag(...)`, `addTag(...)`, `removeTag(...)`, `toggleTag(...)`, etc.

This means that you can now let your domain model and observable types implement ``Taggable`` and automatically get access to a bunch of logic.


## Views

TagKit has views to make it easier to work with tags. For instance, ``TagList`` let you list and edit tags, ``TagCapsule`` renders a tag, and ``TagTextField`` slugifies text as you type.

The image above shows very plain tag capsules, but you can style these capsules in any way you like, or even replace them with your own custom views.


## Conclusion

[TagKit]({{project.url}}) is small library, but I like how creating these small, focused packages makes it easy to reuse functionality and share what you create. If you try it out, I hope you like it.
