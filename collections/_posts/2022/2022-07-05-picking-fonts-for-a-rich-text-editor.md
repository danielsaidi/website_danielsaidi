In this post, we'll look at how to list and pick fonts for a rich text editor that supports UIKit, AppKit and SwiftUI.

## Conclusion

Although UIKit and AppKit has a bunch of built-in support for rich text, font management is still lacking a bunch of features. I hope that this post has made some things clearer and that you found the various examples interesting. 

You can find the source code in the [RichTextKit]({{page.richtextkit}}) library, which I will evolve over time.

Thanks for reading!
