  In this talk, we take a look at how Apple's vision of 3rd party iOS apps went
  from mobile web browser experiences to the native apps we have today. We then
  go through a case study on how a Swedish high-profile company replaced their
  native apps with custom-made, hybrid apps that wrapped their new responsive web site.
