I formed Eblis in 1999 and was lucky to get the amazing Victor Larsson and Tomas Modin to join. In the studio, we got help from many friends, which made the recordings very special and creative. 

While recording "Idol Enslaved", our producer Magnus Ventinen said "I'll be back" and went off the grid for several, just to return with an old, insanely heavy organ that he though would sound cool. He wired up a Frankenstein creation, and sure enough - it sounded amazing.
