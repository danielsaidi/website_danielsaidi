title: Tweaking the NDepend CQL rules to leverage awesome power

After learning on how to automate and schedule NDepend to run for several .NET
solutions at once and starting to use NDepend more regularly, the power of CQL
has grown on me.

For instance, one big problem that I have wrestled with at work is that the code
contains static fields for non-static-should-be fields. In a web context, that's
a big no-no for user-specific state.

Prior to CQL, I used to search for "static" in the entire .NET solution, then go
through the search result. It was exhausting and a non-viable approach.

As I yesterday dug into the standard CQL rules, to get a better understanding of
the NDepend analysis tools, I noticed the following standard CQL:

	// <Name>Static fields should be prefixed with a 's_'</Name>
	WARN IF Count > 0 IN SELECT FIELDS WHERE 
	 !NameLike "^s_" AND 
	 IsStatic AND 
	 !IsLiteral AND 
	 !IsGeneratedByCompiler AND 
	 !IsSpecialName AND 
	 !IsEventDelegateObject 

	// This naming convention provokes debate.
	// Don't hesitate to customize the regex of 
	// NameLike to your preference.

This rule is just awesome! I just had to edit the CQL to

	// <Name>Static fields should not exist...mostly</Name>
	WARN IF Count > 0 IN SELECT FIELDS WHERE 
	 IsStatic AND 
	 !IsLiteral AND 
	 !IsGeneratedByCompiler AND 
	 !IsSpecialName AND 
	 !IsEventDelegateObject 

	// This naming convention provokes debate.
	// Don't hesitate to customize the regex of 
	// NameLike to your preference.

and voil√°: NDepend will now automatically find all static fields in the solution
and ignore NDepend's default naming conventions.

Since this got me going, I also went ahead to modify the following rule

	// <Name>Instance fields should be prefixed with a 'm_'</Name>
	WARN IF Count > 0 IN SELECT FIELDS WHERE 
	 !NameLike "^m_" AND 
	 !IsStatic AND 
	 !IsLiteral AND 
	 !IsGeneratedByCompiler AND 
	 !IsSpecialName AND 
	 !IsEventDelegateObject 

	// This naming convention provokes debate.
	// Don't hesitate to customize the regex of 
	// NameLike to your preference.

to instead require that fields are camel cased:

	// <Name>Instance fields should be camelCase</Name>
	WARN IF Count > 0 IN SELECT FIELDS WHERE 
	 !NameLike "^[a-z]" AND 
	 !IsLiteral AND 
	 !IsGeneratedByCompiler AND 
	 !IsSpecialName AND 
	 !IsEventDelegateObject

These two small changes to the original setup proved to be insanely helpful.
Another great thing is that when you edit the queries in `VisualNDepend`, you 
get an immediate, visual feedback to how the rule applies to the entire solution.
