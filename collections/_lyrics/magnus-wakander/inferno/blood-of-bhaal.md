Blood of Bhaal

We open up your veins
Unleash the crimson stream
Cut you through your screams
To let him in

Every cut a prayer
Every breath a plea
Every scream a way
To let him in

Through this rite of passage 
Through your puny pleas 
Through your pain and grief 
We let him in

Bleeder of the blood
Is all you have to be
Serve him as you bleed
Set him free

Every cut a prayer
Every breath a scream
Serve him as you bleed
Set him free

You only have to suffer
You only have to kneel
Serve him as you bleed
Set him free

In your heart his darkness
In your soul his seed
Serve him as you bleed
Set him free

Blood of Bhaal
Praise his return
Through blood he’s reborn
Bleed his rebirth

Your blood
Feeds the ever-flowing stream
Your screams
Wake him from his dreams
Your pleas
Lead him to your sanctum
Your pain
Feeds him what he needs
Your mind
Is the soil of his soul
Your body
Is now the vessel of a god


Blood of Bhaal


He ravages your soul
Fills up your broken mind
Strengthened your pain 
He grows inside

You only have to shatter
You only have to break
Your only have to fall
Let him take it all

As your heart goes silent
As your soul goes void
As you turn to soil
He unfolds

Vessel of Bhaal
Is all you have to be
Surrender your flesh 
Set him free

Every limb a promise
Every limb a gift
Serve him as you fade
Set him free

You no longer have to suffer
You no longer have to kneel
Serve him as you fade
Set him free

Through your mouth he speaks 
Through your lungs he breathes 
Through your eyes his sees
Set him free

Blood of Bhaal
Praise his return
Through blood he reigns
Bleed his rebirth

Blood of Bhaal
Hail his ascent
Through blood he rules
Bleed his rebirth

Blood of Bhaal
Bleed his return
Through blood he reigns
Bleed his rebirth
