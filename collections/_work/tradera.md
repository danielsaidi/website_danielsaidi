I joined Tradera as a backend developer, but became responsible for bringing the mobile apps for iOS and Android back in-house, from an external agency and to build new ones.

The goal with the new apps for iOS & Android, was to create hybrid apps that could reuse as much as possible from the new, responsive web.

To solve this, I created a hybrid framework for both platforms, that adjusted the web to run as an app within a native framework, all powered by a bidirectional configuration engine.

This engine made it possible for the apps to display content from the web, excluding some parts that were explicitly excluded by the configuration engine. 

The apps also got support for local reminders and push notifications, as well as other native features like deep links.
