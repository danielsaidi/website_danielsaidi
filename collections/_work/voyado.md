I joined Voyado as Head of Mobile, to develop a mobile strategy and to implement a mobile platform for 3rd party integrations.

While there, I developed a mobile-focused web API, as well as a white-label app platform that used the API to connect to the Voyado platform. 

One such app was an iOS and Android app for a Swedish restaurant chain, that was used to push user-specific offers, let users navigate to the nearest restaurant etc.

The API was created in .NET and C# and provided functionality like offers, authentication, SMS integrations etc. The app foundation was built in [Ionic Framework]({{page.ionic}}).
