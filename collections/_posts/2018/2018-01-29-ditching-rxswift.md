After hearing so many good things about RxSwift, I decided to use it in an app of mine. However, after struggling with it for months, I still haven't found a nice setup and have now decided to ditch it. 

I think my old code is much better (more readable, less complex, less error-prone etc.) and will use this post to motivate my decision and post before and after samples to illustrate how ditching RxSwift made my app better and more fun to work with.


## About the app

The app is a pretty small map-based app, where users can save custom geo data. I use `Realm` for data persistency, which means that the data layer is synchronous. Still, the service design is asynchronous, to make the app flexible.

Since all services are potentially asynchronous, I thought this was a great use case for RxSwift. I also decided to use rx for data binding and for gestures as well, using `RxCocoa` and `RxGestures`. In this post, I'll call them RxSwift to simplify things. They are, however, separate libraries.

As I begun adding RxSwift to my app, I quickly ran into some initial problems.


## Official Documentation

My first problems was the official RxSwift documentation, which I think goes too deep into the semantics and terminology from start, without a good initial onboarding and understandable examples. I later found great blogs that explain the concepts better, but think the official docs could be drastically improved.

For nice posts about RxSwift as well as reactive programming in general, check out [Ray Wenderlich's](https://www.raywenderlich.com/138547/getting-started-with-rxswift-and-rxcocoa) and [Adam Borek's](adamborek.com/) posts.


## Dispose bag

Being no stranger to reactive programming, I still think RxSwift requires some strange setup. The `dispose bag` concept was such a thing, where you have to use a dispose bag to manage how observables are disposed.

In the app, I had huge problems when using single a bag for service observables, data bindings and gesture binding. Knowing when to manually dispose this bag was a nightmare, since some observables should be disposed when a screen disappeared, some when data was reloaded, some never etc. I never found a nice setup for this and never found any good examples that fit my requirements.

Furthermore, Adam Borek has many great posts where he illustrates how easy it is to introduce memory leaks by using a dispose bag incorrectly and how observables will stop broadcasting if one update fails. Most of these examples are difficult to catch at a glance, which means that it's easy to accidentally add serious and hard-found bugs to your app if you use RxSwift without knowing exactly what you're doing.


## Wrapping up my concerns

My overall impression after all this is that RxSwift makes it very easy to add bugs and memory leaks to your apps, and requires you to handle built-in problems by introducing complex setups. You have to know exactly how to use a dispose bag (see Adam's post about why table view cells are tricky), or else your app will become a mess. So in order to succeed with RxSwift, you will have to go all in. So will the rest of your team.

This makes adding RxSwift a big decision, since everyone is forced to adopt a reactive programming style. If you compare it with e.g. `AwaitKit`, I think the latter adds a great util set to your app without forcing you to change your overall programming style. RxSwift, however, requires serious commitment.

Furthermore, I think that RxSwift throws a too extensive toolbox at you, which binds you hard to the library. Besides the observables, singles and completables, you'll soon face `drivers` and other ux-specific components.

I think you should ask yourself if you think that RxSwift brings you good value for all this complexity. I personally think the answer is `no`.


## Replacing RxSwift with vanilla UIKit

I will end this post with some examples on how some parts of the code looks with RxSwift and how the same functionality looks with plain UIKit.


### Example 1: Alert

First, let's have a look at an alert class that I display when the user tapped a "create new map" button. This is the (somewhat cleaned up) code with RxSwift:


```swift
class CreateMapAlert: UIAlertController {
    
    fileprivate lazy var service: MapService = IoC.resolve()
    
    static func present(from vc: UIViewController) -> Observable<Map?> {
        return Observable.create { observer in
            let alert = createActionSheet(with: observer)
            vc.present(alert, animated: true)
            return Disposables.create {
                alert.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
            }
        }
    }
}

fileprivate extension CreateMapAlert {
    
    func addCancelAction(with observer: AnyObserver<Map?>) {
        let title = L10n.cancel.string
        let action = UIAlertAction(title: title, style: .cancel) { _ in
            observer.onCompleted()
        }
        addAction(action)
    }

    func addNameTextField() {
        addTextField { textField in
            textField.autocapitalizationType = .words
            textField.placeholder = L10n.name.string
        }
    }
    
    func addOkAction(with observer: AnyObserver<Map?>) {
        let title = L10n.create.string
        let action = UIAlertAction(title: title, style: .default) { _ in
            self.createMap(with: observer)
        }
        addAction(action)
    }
    
    static func createActionSheet(with observer: AnyObserver<Map?>) -> CreateMapAlert {
        let title = L10n.createMapTitle.string
        let message = L10n.createMapMessage.string
        let alert = CreateMapAlert(title: title, message: message, preferredStyle: .alert)
        alert.addNameTextField()
        alert.addOkAction(with: observer)
        alert.addCancelAction(with: observer)
        return alert
    }
    
    func createMap(with observer: AnyObserver<Map?>) {
        guard let text = textFields?.first?.text else { return }
        let name = text.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces)
        guard name.count > 0 else { return }
        service.createMap(named: name).subscribe(onSuccess: { map in
            observer.onNext(map)
            observer.onCompleted()
        }, onError: { error in
            observer.onError(error)
        }).dispose()
    }
}
```

Presenting this alert involves catching the returned observable and adding it to the dispose bag, like this:

```swift
func addMap() {
    let alert = CreateMapAlert.present(from: self)
    alert.subscribe(onNext: { [weak self] _ in
        self?.reloadMaps()
    }, onError: { [weak self] error in
        self?.alert(error)
    }).disposed(by: disposeBag)
}
```

When I first created this alert, I thought it was a pretty cool setup, but I now find it to be unnecessarily complicated. 

Below is a plain UIKit replacement. Instead of an observable, I instead pass a completion block. The present function thus doesn't return anything.

```swift
class CreateMapAlert: UIAlertController {
    
    fileprivate lazy var service: MapService = IoC.resolve()
    
    static func present(from vc: UIViewController, completion: @escaping (Map?) -> ()) {
        let title = L10n.createMapTitle.string
        let message = L10n.createMapMessage.string
        let alert = CreateMapAlert(title: title, message: message, preferredStyle: .alert)
        alert.addNameTextField()
        alert.addOkAction(with: completion)
        alert.addCancelAction(with: completion)
        vc.present(alert, animated: true)
    }
}


// MARK: Private functions

fileprivate extension CreateMapAlert {
    
    func addCancelAction(with completion: @escaping (Map?) -> ()) {
        let title = L10n.cancel.string
        addAction(UIAlertAction(title: title, style: .cancel) { _ in
            completion(nil)
        })
    }

    func addNameTextField() {
        addTextField { textField in
            textField.autocapitalizationType = .words
            textField.placeholder = L10n.name.string
        }
    }
    
    func addOkAction(with completion: @escaping (Map?) -> ()) {
        let title = L10n.create.string
        addAction(UIAlertAction(title: title, style: .default) { _ in
            let map = self.createMap()
            completion(map)
        })
    }
    
    func createMap() -> Map? {
        guard let text = textFields?.first?.text else { return nil }
        let name = text.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces)
        guard name.count > 0 else { return nil }
        return service.createMap(named: name)
    }
}
```

Instead of adding a returned observable to a dispose bags, presenting this alert only involves passing in a completion block, like this:

```swift
func addMap() {
    CreateMapAlert.present(from: self) { [weak self] in
        self?.reloadMaps()
    }
}
```

I think this is a much more readable and straightforward approach, which also is a lot less error-prone.


### Example 2: Tap Gesture

This example is a lot shorter, and involves tap gesture binding using RxSwift, compared to the standard selector-based approach.

This is how you setup a bar button item a tap action with RxSwift:


```swift
func setupAddButton() {
    let add = UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .add, target: nil, action: nil)
    add.rx.tap.subscribe(onNext: { [weak self] in
        self?.addMap()
    }).disposed(by: disposeBag)
    navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = add
}
```

As I ditched RxSwift, this is how I now set it up, using standard selectors:

```swift
func setupAddButton() {
    let action = #selector(addMap)
    let add = UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .add, target: self, action: action)
    navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = add
}
```

I don't like selectors at all, but I think the UIKit code is a lot better. I would prefer action blocks, though.


### Example 3: Long Press Gesture

I usually prefer to setup outlets in `didSet`, instead of calling setup functions in `viewDidLoad`. However, with RxSwift, setting up a long press gesture is rather nasty, which made me set it up like this:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    setupMapView()
}

func setupMapView() {
    guard let view = mapView else { return }
    setupMapViewLongPress(for: view)
}

func setupMapViewLongPress(for view: MKMapView) {
    view.rx.longPressGesture()
        .when(.began)
        .subscribe(onNext: { [weak self] gesture in
            let point = gesture.location(in: view)
            let coordinate = view.convert(point, toCoordinateFrom: view)
            self?.addUnsavedAnnotation(at: coordinate)
        }).disposed(by: disposeBag)
}
```

If we'd add the rx code to the `didSet` block, I think the property would become too big. With UIKit, however, I think this is not the case:

```swift
@IBOutlet weak var mapView: ComboMapView? {
    didSet {
        mapView?.showsUserLocation = true
        let action = #selector(mapViewLongPressed(_:))
        mapView?.addLongPressAction(action, target: self)
    }
}

func mapViewLongPressed(_ gesture: UILongPressGestureRecognizer) {
    guard let view = mapView else { return }
    let point = gesture.location(in: view)
    let coordinate = view.convert(point, toCoordinateFrom: view)
    addUnsavedAnnotation(at: coordinate)
}
```

By not using RxSwift, we also remove several indentation levels. Not too bad.


### Example 4: UITextView delegate

Now, this is a bit tricky. I hate having to implement `UITextViewDelegate` to be able to handle what happens in a `UITextView`. However, consider this rx code:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    setupCommentTextView()
}

func setupCommentTextView() {
    guard let view = commentText else { return }
    setupCommentTextViewEditing(for: view)
}

func setupCommentTextViewEditing(for view: UITextView) {
    view.rx.didBeginEditing
        .subscribe(onNext: { [weak self] in
            self?.setupDoneButton(for: view)
            view.setupPlaceholderBeforeEditing()
        }).disposed(by: disposeBag)
    
    view.rx.didEndEditing
        .subscribe(onNext: { [weak self] in
            self?.endEditing(for: view)
            view.setupPlaceholderAfterEditing(text: L10n.enterComment.string)
        }).disposed(by: disposeBag)
}

```

I think the above is horrible, especially compared to the UIKit alternative:

```swift
@IBOutlet weak var commentTextView: UITextView? {
	didSet { commentTextView?.delegate = self }
}

func textViewDidBeginEditing(_ textView: UITextView) {
	setupDoneButton(for: textView)
	textView.setupPlaceholderBeforeEditing()
}

func textViewDidEndEditing(_ textView: UITextView) {
	endEditing(for: textView)
	textView.setupPlaceholderAfterEditing(text: L10n.enterComment.string)
}
```

So, delegates are horrible, but in my opinion, RxSwift is even worse.


## Conclusion

These are just my five cents. Maybe I've misunderstood everything about RxSwift. I would love comments and discussions in the comment field below.
