I have always loved music and written songs since I was a kid. I started my first band at 15 and recorded a bunch of demos and [an EP]({{page.midnightenlightened}}) at 18 and [a full-length album]({{page.forsaken}}) at 20.

I have played everything from pop to rock and metal, done vocals in all bands and guitars in some. I did stop playing bands when I became a dad in 2008, and have since then only done if for fun, whenever I do have time. The music I play on my own is guitar-based and pretty basic.
