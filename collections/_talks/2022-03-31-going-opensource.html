title: Going Open-Source

abstract: |
  I gave this talk at MalagaMobile in March 2022, and later at
  Copenhagen Cocoa, on my experiences of working on many 
  open-source projects, how to get started and how to manage
  closed-source projects.

conference-abstract: |
  Some of the best software in the world is created in the open, maintained by people who join in their effort to solve problems and share their work with the world. Open-source software comes in all shapes and sizes, from operating systems like Linux and Android, programming languages like Swift and crucial tools like cURL, to tiny hobby projects only used by a handful of people.

  Regardless of your ambitions, the first steps on your open-source journey can be scary. How do you start? Where do you put the code? How are people going to add it to their projects? And what about pull requests? Don't worry, this talk has you covered!
  
  In this talk, we'll look at how to get started with open-source, when a good opportunity to do so may be and things you should consider when doing so. We’ll look at how to set up a new package with the Swift Package Manager, write documentation in DocC, automate things with Fastlane etc. We will also discuss how having an open-source oriented mindset can help you out in other situations as well, such as when maintaining software shared between teams in an organization. 
  
  The talk will focus on Swift, Xcode and GitHub, but most topics are universal.

  # Commercial Failure
  ## Story Time
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  # Today
  
  Open-source is everywhere
  
  GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket etc.
  
  SPM, Gradle, NPM etc.
  
  Markdown, Doxygen, DocC etc.
  
  XCFrameworks for closed-source
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  # Some of my projects
  
  (not to promote, bear with me)
  
  UI libs like [Sheeeeeeeeet](https://github.com/danielsaidi/Sheeeeeeeeet) and [SystemNotification](https://github.com/danielsaidi/SystemNotification)
  
  Mono-repos like [SwiftUIKit](https://github.com/danielsaidi/SwiftUIKit)
  
  Test tools like [MockingKit](https://github.com/danielsaidi/MockingKit)
  
  Commercial ones like [KeyboardKit](https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit)

  # My work structure
  
  App-specific code in app target
  
  App-agnostic code in a framework
  
  App-specific framework in app target
  
  No external dependencies in the framework
  
  Unit test the framework, not the app
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  # App to Open-Source
  
  Convert framework to local package
  
  Convert local package to open-source
  
  Documentation with DocC
  
  Automate build process with Fastlane
  
  Demo app, code examples etc.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  ## App-specific frameworks 
  
  Separate domain from app
  
  Reusability between targets
  
  More focus, less distraction
  
  Faster to compile
  
  Easier to test
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  # Local packages
  
  Cleaner separation betwen app and library
  
  Reusability across apps
  
  Increased modularity
  
  Easier to combine packages
  
  Good preparation for open-source
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  # Why Open-Source?
  
  **Better code** - since it's public
  
  **Communication** - what does it do?
  
  **Planning** - what to release, when, how?
  
  **Collaboration** - working with others
  
  **Sharing** - giving back to the community
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  ## Why NOT open-source?
  
  Time consuming
  
  Intellectual property
  
  Work secrets
  
  High volatility
  
  You can still work in an open-source way
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  # Private Projects
  
  Private repo or server
  
  Accessed with SSH instead of HTTPS
  
  SSH gives granular access control
  
  Still "open-source" when used
  
  Perfect for e.g. company projects
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  # Closed-Source
  
  Public repo
  
  Pre-compiled binary, e.g. XCFramework
  
  Can be protected with a license
  
  Can use documentation, issues etc.
  
  Perfect for commercial projects
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  # Good Practices
  
  System design, access control etc.
  
  Only expose the essential
  
  Abstractions and loose coupling
  
  Test, test, test
  
  Automate, automate, automate
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  # License
  
  Very important!
  
  Code without license is NOT open-source
  
  Without license, the author has all rights
  
  MIT is common, very allowing
  
  Others, like BSD, CPL, GPL etc.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  # Conclusion
  
  Open-source can be very rewarding
  
  Can also be very demanding
  
  Set clear expectations on yourself
  
  Communicate your ambitions and intent
  
  Have fun!
