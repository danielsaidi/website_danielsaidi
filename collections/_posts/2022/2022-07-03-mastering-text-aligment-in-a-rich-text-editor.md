In this post, we'll look at how to handle text alignment in a rich text editor that supports UIKit, AppKit and SwiftUI. We'll look at how to get and set the alignment for a certain range as well as for the current position, and why this is more complicated than plain attributes like font and underline style.


## Background

Mention master post...
Link to this from master post...

Attributes (link to post)

Basic range function
Text view current function
Context + coordinator


## Conclusion

Although UIKit and AppKit has a bunch of built-in support for rich text, a lot is still missing. I hope that this post has made some things clearer and that you found the various examples interesting. 

You can find the source code in the [RichTextKit]({{page.richtextkit}}) library, which I will evolve over time.

Thanks for reading!
