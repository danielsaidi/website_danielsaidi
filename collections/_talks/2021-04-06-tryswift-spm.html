abstract: |
  I gave this workshop at two occasions at the try! Swift World online
  workshop conference 2021. In the workshop, we look at how to use the
  Swift Package Manager (SPM) to distribute closed-source software and
  use it to protect your most valuable secrets.

conference-abstract: |
  Open-source is an amazing way to contribute to the developer community. However, there may come a time when you want to keep your source code closed and not share it with the world. Perhaps you want to protect some sophisticated or business-critical piece of logic or distribute it with a commercial license?

  In this workshop, we will look at how to use the Swift Package Manager (SPM) to distribute closed-source software. We will create an open-source library from scratch and extend it with pro features in a closed-source, pre-compiled framework, then use SPM to distribute both libraries. We will also look at how to work around some of the current limitations that exist with SPM. We will start from the very basics, so you will be able to follow along even if you haven't used SPM before.

  ## In this workshop
  * Create an open-source library
  * Create a closed-source library
  * Create a multi-platform demo app
  * Fail intentionally, to learn
  * Discussions
</section>

<section data-markdown class="image-section" data-background="{{assets}}bg.jpg">
  ## Swift Package Manager
  * Dependency Manager (like CocoaPods & Carthage)
  * Developed by Apple, built into Xcode
  * Evolves with every Swift release
  * Still lacks a bunch of power features
  * Quick demo(?)
</section>

<section data-markdown class="image-section" data-background="{{assets}}bg.jpg">
  ## Open-Source
  * Get help from the community
  * Give back to the community
  * Develop your skills
  * Get freelance gigs
  * Have fun with others
</section>

<section data-markdown class="image-section" data-background="{{assets}}bg.jpg">
  ## Closed-Source
  * Google, Realm, Facebook
  * Business critical code
  * Intellectual property
  * Secret information
  * Commercial licenses
</section>

<section data-markdown class="image-section" data-background="{{assets}}bg.jpg">
  ## Workshop libraries
  * We will create two libraries/packages
  * trySwiftColorKit - SwiftUI Colors & Utils
  * trySwiftColorKitPro - Additional Pro Colors
  * The Core library will be open-source
  * The Pro library will be closed-source
</section>

<section data-markdown class="image-section" data-background="{{assets}}bg.jpg">
  ## Workshop repositories
  * Three(!) GitHub repositories:
  * https://github.com/danielsaidi/trySwiftColorKit
  * https://github.com/danielsaidi/trySwiftColorKitProSource
  * https://github.com/danielsaidi/trySwiftColorKitPro
  * Every commit is a distinct step
