Rattlesnake


Like a rattlesnake's
Venomous bite
Your fangs are out
To keep you safe tonight

Like a rattlesnake
Prepared to bite
Living is easy when we stay away

I'm taking my chance
I'm taking is slow
I'm coming closer
You're letting me in

But I'm not afraid
You open your arms and let me enter again
Like a rattlesnake
It's just defense
Living is hard
When you're on the fence

And so it begins
You're letting me in
Arms pressing harder
And I'm diving in

So hold me
Hold me
Hold me in your arms
So hold me
Hold me
Hold me in your arms
