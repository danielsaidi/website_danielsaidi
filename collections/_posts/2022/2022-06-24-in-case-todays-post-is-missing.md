In case today's post is missing, I may still be recovering from a minor shoulder surgery that I underwent on Wednesday. I may also be one-armed and unable to type if the surgery went bad, and even dead if it went really bad. However, since it's also Swedish midsummer today, I may just be off enjoying life like a normal Swedish person.

I will try my best to update this post to give you my current status, even if it just means that I will adjust the text to say that I'm alive and that the surgery went well.

However, if you don't see any more posts on this blog, I may actually have passed away during surgery (let's not be morbid, but you really don't know). In that case, I hope that you all take really good care of my various [GitHub repositories]({{page.github}}). Fork them, nurture them and make sure that they remain well-behaved libraries that take care of the developers who rely on them.

Also, make sure to listen to my latest album [Soul Bleed]({{page.album}}), that I made with Magnus Wakander. If I'm to die at such young age, let's at least make the music I left behind as famous as Mozart's. Also do reach out to my wife Johanna, and require her to publish my many demos on Spotify. It's the least she can do.

With that said, I hope that I'll be back in time to update this post, and that I survive surgery. If not, it has been nice to have you as a reader. Sorry for the morbid tone in this post. I guess it comes with growing up in the ironic 90's.

Love

Daniel Saidi
