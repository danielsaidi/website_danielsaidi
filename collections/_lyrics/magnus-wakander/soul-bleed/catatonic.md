Your life, a pathetic waste of time
A sorry excuse passing by
As you lie, vacant and hollow
Only waiting to die

Your time, running out
But you don’t mind
It’s time, to let go of this life
Existence they call it
Let’s face it
It’s just a demise
You never even tried
You just gave up with a sigh
Now you lie
Surrounded by the screams of those who tried

You never, never move
Not ever, not even as the world now tremors
Not once, not ever
You’ll stay catatonic forever

Your life, created and ruined at once
You never had a chance
You gave up on the spot
Lay down, closed your eyes, stopped moving and just shut down
Turned dead to the eyes of the world
Before you even spoke a first word
Unheard, you sank into the void and made yourself undisturbed

You never, never moved
Not ever, not even as the world did tremor
Not once, not ever
You stayed catatonic forever

What’s not striving can’t be misguided
What’s not wishing can’t be seduced
What’s not hoping can’t be disappointed
What’s not trusting can’t be betrayed

What’s not seeing can’t be distracted
What’s not hearing can’t be alarmed
What’s not breathing can’t be infected
What’s not living can’t be destroyed

Your life, reduced to the faintest of sighs
A pathetic waste of time
You just lie, not worth the effort to cry as you finally die
However, they too will die
Regardless of how well they tried
The end arrives as they scream as they cry as they die

Your time, running out
But you don’t mind
It’s time, to let go of this life
Existence they called it
Let’s face: it’s just a demise
You never even tried
You just gave up with a sigh
Now you lie, smiling
As everyone around you dies

What’s not striving can’t be misguided
What’s not wishing can’t be seduced
What’s not hoping can’t be disappointed
What’s not trusting can’t be betrayed

What’s not seeing can’t be distracted
What’s not hearing can’t be alarmed
What’s not breathing can’t be infected
What’s not living can’t be destroyed
