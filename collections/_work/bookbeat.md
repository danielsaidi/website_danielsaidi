I joined BookBeat as iOS & Mobile Architecture Lead in 2016, shortly after the first public iOS release. While there, BookBeat went from 4 to 28 markets and 500.000 monthly users.

As iOS Lead, I refactored the iOS app from an app monolith to a package-based system, that powered apps for iOS, watchOS, tvOS & CarPlay, with no business logic in the apps.

The iOS app started migrating from UIKit to SwiftUI as SwiftUI launched in 2019, and was the first regional audiobook service to support CarPlay & watchOS with download support.

Besides the pure technical parts, BookBeat was also highly focused on accessibility, with support for dark mode, voice over, high contrast colors, dynamic type and more.
