We are the ones you never sees
As long as you’re alive
It’s time to start this feast
As you loose to disease

We come alive as death enters your flesh
An invitation to what’s no longer left
Rotting and cold you leave yourself behind

It’s time for you to leave
Its time for us to feed
I’m inviting all my friends
Let death worms win

Death worms hiding
We are the death inside of you
Death worms sliding
We are the death inside of you
Death worms smiling
We are the death inside of you

We slither through your veins as a parade
Gnawing at even the smallest of remains
As a gift you’ve left your flesh behind

Death alive in you
Death alive in you
Death alive in you
Death alive

When your body runs out
Devoured and turned to earth
Rejoined with the soil
We move out

We come alive where death takes hold of life
A new beginning leading to the end
When nothing’s left we leave your bones behind

Death worms hiding
We are the death inside of you
Death worms sliding
We are the death inside of you
Death worms smiling
We are the death inside of you

We are the death, the death inside of you
We are the death, the death inside of you
We are the death, the death inside of you

Death alive in you
Death alive in you
Death alive in you
Death alive
