When you love me

It's the way you xxx
Every time you do
Do you love me?
Do you love me now?

It's the way you xxx
Every time you do
Do you love me?
Do you love me now?

And the waves will crash
And the sun will burn
When you love me
When you love me

All my senses back
All my will to live
When you love me
When you love me
When you love me
