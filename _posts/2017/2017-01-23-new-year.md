I finally made it! After years and years of "I really shouldn't", I have finally
managed to abandon my old hosting provider and move all my sites to GitHub.

For years, I have had to use FTP to update my different web sites, since my old
hosting provider hasn't kept up. This has had the effect that I have not updated
my sites that often, since it has been a hassle. In a world where I enjoy using
git almost everywhere, these old ways had to end.

Since this decision was made just before my hosting contract was about to end, I
was in a rush to get this in place. This was perfect, since it forced me to get
it done, instead of spending another year in FTP hell. I thus decided to freeze
my sites and push them to [GitHub](http://github.com) as static web sites. Since
GitHub lets you use custom domain names for free, this was a golden start.

At first, I decided to disable `Jekyll` for all sites (more on that later), since
it is enabled by default and I didn't have time to learn it before my hosting got
cancelled. However, as I finished moving my sites, I decided to to dig into this
great tool and enable it for this web site as a start.

In short, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator that lets you
build static web sites (html + css + javascript) with convenient tools like data
files, layout files, pages, posts, custom collections etc. It's nothing less than
amazing and the result is lightning fast, since there are no backend or database,
just plain html files and javascript.

It's rather ironic that I've spent so much time on refining my sytem development
skills, just to end up with a static site generator, but you have to be pragmatic
and pick the best tool for the job. In this case, Jekyll is awesome.

With all this in place, I will begin to move my blog from Wordpress to this site
as well. Wordpress has been terrible for writing about tech and code. Instead, I
will now use Jekyll and write posts using `MarkDown`. It will be a huge relief.

Until I have completed the tedious task of moving the entire blog from Wordpress,
my old posts can be found at [Wordpress](http://danielsaidi.wordpress.com).

All the best

Daniel
