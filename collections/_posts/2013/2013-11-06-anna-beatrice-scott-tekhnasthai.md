This is a sum-up of a talk I attended at Øredev 2013. This year, I will create a 
separate post for each session, instead of having multiple sessions in each post.

After getting my goodiebag (containing a copy of xkcd volume 0!) and watching a
fun intro about why we are here and why the theme of the year is The Arts, it was
time for Anna to kick-start Øredev 2013.

Being a dancer, professor and writer, Anna was asked to bring some sunlight with
her from California (trope alert!), to this dark part of the world. Instead, she
brought quirky moves, where she twisted and moved like a reptilian shape shifter, 
to music streaming out of her unplugged laptop.

Eventually, a guy came up on stage and plugged in the computer, sending music out
into the room and restoring order and balance to the universe.

Anna then talked about art. Has art been hijacked? Today, anyone can be an artist.
What is the definition of art? What does the dictionary say? She went through all
definitions available, while mixing it up with more music, never-ending "everybody
please stand" orders, to which everyone naturally obeyed...who says no to a guest
from AMERICA? Jesus!

The big theme of Anna's keynote was disruptance, where she dissected change. It 
was interesting, and she had some nice one-liners (The problem with keeping your
head down, is that you're stuck navel gazing), but all this jumping back and forth
between art, disruptance, dancing, art, disruptance, change, moving, bending etc.
was impossible to take seriously. I found it embarrassingly bad and would dare to
claim that no Swede would ever step up on stage, doing what Anna did...

...and quite frankly, I'm glad that we don't. This juvenile admiration for all
things American has to stop.
