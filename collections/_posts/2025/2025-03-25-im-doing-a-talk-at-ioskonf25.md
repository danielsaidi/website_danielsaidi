I'm very excited to do a talk on how to distribute and monetize closed-source SDKs with the Swift Package Manager, at the iOSKonf25 conference in Skopje, North Macedonia in May.

While open-source is a great way to share your work and collaborate with others, it’s not a suitable model for projects that build on intellectual property, code or resources that need to be protected.

In this talk, we’ll take a look at how to set up, distribute, and monetize a closed-source SDK with the Swift Package Manager. We’ll dive into practical topics like how to set up your product to keep the source code private and the distribution and documentation public, and how to leverage the Swift Package Manager for distribution. 

This talk also covers how to protect a closed-source SDK with a commercial license, how to design a business model for various audiences, how to provide enterprise-grade support and features, like custom SLAs and software escrow services, and other things to consider for your long-term success.

This talk builds on my almost 10-year-long experience of evolving my open-source KeyboardKit project to offer a commercial Pro add-on. It covers development and business considerations, and offers insights for developers and companies who are looking to commercialize their source code.

I'm hoping to see you at [iOSKonf25] in Skopje, North Macedonia! I'm staying there from Monday 12 to Saturday 17. Let me know if you want to meet up!
