abstract: |  
  This talk explores the fundamentals of Xcode string catalogs, brand new improvements in Xcode 26, and key differences between app and package implementations.
  
  We'll also look at how to create a centralized localization package that can be shared across multiple apps and packages in your ecosystem, streamlining your localization workflow.
