Today, my collegue Johan showed me a css fix for a problem that happens when a
div container has nested, floating divs. 

The fix makes the div container not resize itself according to the size of its
nested elements, as such:

As you see, the div doesn't adjust its size according to the nested elements. It
can be fixed, though, by this nice little CSS class:

```css
.fc:after{content:".";clear:both;display:block;visibility:hidden;height:0;}
* html .fc{height:1px;}
```

Just add the `fc` css class to the div container element, and the result will be
as such:
