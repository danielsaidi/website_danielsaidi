In this post, let's take a look at how to we can extend SwiftUI with a document scanner that uses the device camera to scan documents in iOS.

{% include kankoda/data/open-source name="SwiftUIKit" %}

To do this, we'll use the [Vision]({{page.vision}}) framework to create a `VNDocumentCameraViewController` and embed it in SwiftUI for a seamless developer experience.


## Creating the camera view

Let's start with creating a SwiftUI `DocumentCamera` view:

```swift
struct DocumentCamera: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    
    init(
        cancelAction: @escaping CancelAction = {},
        resultAction: @escaping ResultAction) {
        self.cancelAction = cancelAction
        self.resultAction = resultAction
    }
    
    typealias CameraResult = Result<VNDocumentCameraScan, Error>
    typealias CancelAction = () -> Void
    typealias ResultAction = (CameraResult) -> Void
    
    private let cancelAction: CancelAction
    private let resultAction: ResultAction
        
    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> VNDocumentCameraViewController {
        let controller = VNDocumentCameraViewController()
        // controller.delegate = ???
        return controller
    }
    
    func updateUIViewController(
        _ uiViewController: VNDocumentCameraViewController,
        context: Context) {}
}
```

The view implements `UIViewControllerRepresentable`, since it will wrap a UIKit controller. We also define a few typealiases to make the code easier to read.

We create our camera view controller instance in `makeUIViewController`. However, since the controller communicates through delegation, we need a way to listen to these events.


## Creating the coordinator

SwiftUI views are value types that can be recreated at any time. This means they're poor candidates for delegation. Most often, it's not even allowed to let a value type implement certain delegate protocols.

To solve this, we can define a `Coordinator` for the view, then use it as the delegate:

```swift
@available(iOS 13, *)
public extension DocumentCamera {
    
    class Coordinator: NSObject, VNDocumentCameraViewControllerDelegate {
        
        public init(
            cancelAction: @escaping DocumentCamera.CancelAction,
            resultAction: @escaping DocumentCamera.ResultAction) {
            self.cancelAction = cancelAction
            self.resultAction = resultAction
        }
        
        private let cancelAction: DocumentCamera.CancelAction
        private let resultAction: DocumentCamera.ResultAction

        public func documentCameraViewControllerDidCancel(
            _ controller: VNDocumentCameraViewController) {
            cancelAction()
        }
        
        public func documentCameraViewController(
            _ controller: VNDocumentCameraViewController,
            didFailWithError error: Error) {
            resultAction(.failure(error))
        }
        
        public func documentCameraViewController(
            _ controller: VNDocumentCameraViewController,
            didFinishWith scan: VNDocumentCameraScan) {
            resultAction(.success(scan))
        }
    }
}
```

This lets us inject functions that can be triggered by the coordinator when things happen in the camera controller. In this case, we listen for when it cancels, fails, and finishes.


## Using the coordinator

We can now update our `DocumentCamera` to use the coordinator, by rewriting it as such:

```swift
@available(iOS 13, *)
public struct DocumentCamera: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    
    public init(
        cancelAction: @escaping CancelAction = {},
        resultAction: @escaping ResultAction) {
        self.cancelAction = cancelAction
        self.resultAction = resultAction
    }
    
    public typealias CameraResult = Result<VNDocumentCameraScan, Error>
    public typealias CancelAction = () -> Void
    public typealias ResultAction = (CameraResult) -> Void
    
    private let cancelAction: CancelAction
    private let resultAction: ResultAction
        
    public func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {
        Coordinator(
            cancelAction: cancelAction,
            resultAction: resultAction)
    }
    
    public func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> VNDocumentCameraViewController {
        let controller = VNDocumentCameraViewController()
        controller.delegate = context.coordinator
        return controller
    }
    
    public func updateUIViewController(
        _ uiViewController: VNDocumentCameraViewController,
        context: Context) {}
}
```

The `DocumentCamera` passes the actions to the coordinator in `makeCoordinator`, then sets up the context as the controller's delegate, to connect it with the provided actions.


## Conclusion

Wrapping UIKit views and view controllers in SwiftUI is easy. Just make sure to understand when and how to use a coordinator for more complex tasks.

This code could also be adjusted to support async/await, but that's a topic for another post. Just let me know if you'd like to see such a post.
