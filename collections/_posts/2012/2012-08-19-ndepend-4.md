NDepend v4 was released earlier this summer. I have been meaning to try it out for
some time, but life (summer, sun, vacation) and some projects got in the way.



NDepend 4 seems really cool, though, with new LINQ features that I can't wait to
try. Until I do, you can read all about it [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/ricardoperes/archive/2012/06/13/ndepend-4-first-steps.aspx).
