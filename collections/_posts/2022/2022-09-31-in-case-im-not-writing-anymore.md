In case I haven't been blogging for a while, something may have happened that stops me from writing. It could be an accident, or something worse. I don't want to be morbid, but I prefer to be well-prepared, so in case I go silent, here comes some final words.

Earlier this year, I setup a GitHub Action to republish my website on a daily basis. This lets me prepare future content, which takes away the stress of always having to manually publish posts on certain times.

When I was about to undergo surgery in June, I started thinking about the small risks involved with both surgery and anaesthesia. While the risks are small, there are still risks involved, which got me thinking a bit about how to handle if something unexpected would happen.

Writing my final words on a tech blog is perhaps a bit pretentious, but hey - it's the only blog and future content supporting platform I have, so please indulge me this one, perhaps last time.


## Life

Most of you who read this post are probably here for the tech content. It'd be remarkable if not, since it's my main topic. However, there are some other aspects of life that I'd love to take up.

To my wife and daughters - Johanna, Cornelia and Lovisa - I can't express in words how much I love you and what you mean to me. I will always love you to the stars and back.

The same to my mom and dad - Ingrid and Sasan, my brothers Sebastian and Patrick, my niece Julia and family-in law: Gunvor, Sture, Karin, Lars, Theo, Rasmus, Berit, SÃ¶ren, Lilian and Kjell - love you all!


## Music

Besides tech, let me plug some [music]({{page.music}}). Make sure to listen to my latest album [Soul Bleed]({{page.album}}), that I recorded with Magnus Wakander. If I'm to die at a semi-young age, let's at least make it as famous as Mozart.

Thanks to [Misfortune]({{page.bands}}misfortune) for giving me a first musical family, which I with many random acts of teeenagerism didn't always deserve. Thanks to [New Wave Stoner / x:o / sgt. Black]({{page.bands}}sgt-black) for being my new family in our new home town. Thanks to [Kollektivet]({{page.bands}}kollektivet) for taking on and improving my C G Am F creations and for humoring my song-writing ambitions.

For the songs that are not yet up on public services, do reach out to my wife Johanna and require her to publish my many unpublished demos that I have. But not before carefully mastering and polishing each song to perfection. That's the least she can do in this situation, right? ;)



## Open-source

In the case of my demise, I hope that you take good care of my various [GitHub repositories]({{page.github}}). Fork them, nurture them and make sure they remain well-behaved and take care of the people who rely on them.

If you are a KeyboardKit Pro user, I will setup a way for you to get access to the source code. If I haven't contact you with this information before this post goes live, I failed in my ambitions. If so, reach out to my wife - Johanna Saidi - on LinkedIn and she will help you out.

With that said, I hope that this post never goes live. If it does, it has been nice to have you as a reader. Sorry for the somewhat morbid tone in this post. I guess it comes with growing up in the ironic 90's. I'll try to be better in my next life.

Love

Daniel Saidi
