Yhidothrus, hear me
Ravager, see me
Lord of age, time and worms, meet me
Bare your jaws, teeth and maw

Let me travel the
Spiral path with you
Let me cut through the
Outer sphere with you
Qlippoth lord, show me it all

The very few who see you tend to go insane
I’m the only one who still remains
Yhidothrus, conqueror

The feeble cultists of the worm are broken and done
Fearful loners, desperate, and utterly gone
Yhidothrus, bring your teeth into this world

Qlippoth lord, show me it all
Slither through the realms
To the grave beyond
Through the Great Beyond
Connect to all the realms
And bring destruction on
Tear it all down!
Wring your black skin
And cut your teeth through it all
Eat through it all
Hear me lord Yhidothrus 
Show me it all!
Won’t you show me it all?
No one is safe
From the Teeth of Yhidothrus

Yhidothrus, see me
Ravager, meet me
Lord of age, time and worms, eat me
Through your jaws, teeth and maw

Let me travel the
Full length of you
Grant me rebirth
from deep within you
Qlippoth lord, grant me it all

The very few who see you tend to loose it all
I’m the only one to heed your call
Yhidothrus, devourer

The feeble cultists of the worm are broken and gone
Fearful loners, desperate, and broken down
Yhidothrus, sink your teeth into this world

Qlippoth lord, grant me it all
Slither through these realms
To the grave beyond
Through the Great Beyond
Connect to all the realms
And bring destruction on
Tear it all down!
Wring your black skin
And cut your teeth through it all
Eat through it all
Hear me lord Yhidothrus 
Grant me it all!
Grant me it all!
No one is safe
From he Spawn of Yhidothrus
