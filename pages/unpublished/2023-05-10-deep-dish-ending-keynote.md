Deep Dish Swift is done, and what an amazing conference it was! Thanks to all who made it happen. The closing keynote however left me a bit conflicted, and I hope to gather my thoughts on it in this post.

This is not an easy text to write. I don't want to bash other people's work, but I also do not want to shy away from speaking out when I see something that leaves me with a bad feeling. I've never been good at keeping my thoughts to myself when I feel someone should speak up, although speaking up sure hasn't served my career well in the past. I guess this post is evidence that I'll never learn.

While all who read this can easily find out which talk and speaker this refers to, I do not want to name names and point fingers. I'll therefore leave out all names and hope that I manage to stick to the subject.

I also want to acknowledge the speaker, who is a high profile in the Swift community. He has helped so many beginners and junior developers find their way around Swift and SwiftUI and land their first job, and I personally enjoy his yearly summaries of what's new in the latest APIs and truly appreciate his tireless and top quality work and am thankful for the many things he does for the community.

I however believe that the more prominent you become, the more important it is to not only be praised for the good things you do, but to also hear what you can do better and when you err. I would hate it if I acted in a way or said things that made others feel bad, and some of my most important learnings have come from people frankly telling me when I've messed up. Cause boy, have I.

I will try to separate personal preferences from what I think is valid critisism. While I for instance dislikes it when speakers ask the audience to stand up, do this and do that, as if sheeps in a herd, I understand that many find this fun and entertaining and that I should just sit in the back and not participate. That's not what this text is about.

The talk started off very fun, although bit too YouTube screamingly for my taste. I understand that you have to be loud and hyperbole to stand out on YouTube, but as a keynote speaker, people are already listening. Perhaps it was just speaker nerves. The speaker is however a very funny guy, and the friendly banter with various US formats is an example of the many hilarious parts in this talk.

One focus of this talk was however how we tend to turn a blind eye to the huge challenges of our times, and instead focus on smaller problems. While this is indeed true, the way the presenter went about this was in a strange mix of self-celebration and community bashing. The speaker celebrated his newsletter achievements, while at the same time mocking us for wanting to out build social media careers. He then celebrates that many thousand people have completed his code challenge thing, while at the same time shaming the community for bickering about code formatting while the world is literally dying. And so on.

Many in the audience are probably blogging, vlogging and streaming since *the speaker himeself* - a role model in the community - is doing it. Hopefully, most do it with a goal to help people in the same way that he has helped them, to pass it forward, but why shame people for perhaps aiming for a career in that field? Can one not build a social media career and still improve things on a macro level? The speaker himself seems to do so. Or was the intention by this to make all who do it feel ashamed?

Bashing the community for focusing on code structure was also very strange, especially since it was the topic of a talk just a few talks before the ending keynote. What was the point of calling out that speaker and the audience for finding this topic important? Should we feel bad and ashamed for thinking that code structure matters?

The speaker also picked up his phone and launched the Bluesky closed beta (alpha?), enabled VoiceOver and showed us how useless the app is for people with impairments. "This app has launched millions in venture capital and this is the best you can do???". Can you *imagine* if you were an app developer of the Bluesky team, who had worked hard on getting a first beta going despite horrible deadlines, hard challenges just to get a first beta out, and the first thing that happens is that one of the biggest name in the community publicly shame you for ignoring this one aspect of app development? What is the point? That we all in the audience should laugh at the team? A team we know nothing about, with other major challenges involved with coming up with a Twitter (Mastodon, rather) competitor. Imagine sitting in that audience, with the speaker as your role model, then this happens.

This was just so strange to me, how the presenter chose to celebrate his own achievements and bash the work of others. Couldn't the point (an important point) have been driven home with compassion instead of shame? What if instead of shaming us for wanting to build our social media careers, he would have said something like *"I know that many people in here are doing great work in social media. Please use your platforms to do good at a larger scale"*? What if instead of shaming us for bickering about code structure, he would have said something like *"Don't get me wrong, code structure is incredibly important in our line of work, and big thanks to the former speaker for touching on many important points. But please, do not loose track of the bigger picture."*? And what if instead of publicly shaming a company and team who are not there to defend themselves, he would have talked about the importance of accessiblity, and show examples of great apps instead of hitting down on the not so great?

You see, I went to the speaker's personal web site and enabled VoiceOver. While it was not a too bad experience, there were certainly flaws. Many icons did not have alternate texts and weren't read as I focused on them. The links in the footer failed to let me navigate to the last link etc. If you are speaking from a position of power and use your platform to bash others, at least have the decency to live up to the standards you apply to others.

I perhaps shouldn't have written about this finding on Twitter in the way I did, ending with a tear-laughing emoji, but I did. Without naming names. And I got a reply, but the points I have here in the talk were not regarded, but instead dismissed with a comment that he had no intention of replying further. Had I not tweeted in affect, with that emoji, but rather with the underlying indignation that later lad ground to this text, a more constructive discussion could have been had.

I would very much have loved to attend this talk in a parallel universe, where the talk applauded the achievements of the community while encouraging the improvements that can be made, instead of bashing the shortcoming of the people and companies in it. The "forward, together" ending slide now instead felt like, "forward, together"...but only if a certain person gets to stay on top.

I understand that you may develop thick skin as a public person, especially as a YouTuber. Together with making life decisions that can draw the attention of haters, I understand that you over time risk starting to dismiss persons who oppose you as haters, especially when your talks in general end with standing ovations. I hope I don't come around as a hater, and that if the speaker in question should he happen to read this text, he can understand why I didn't like this particular talk all that much.
