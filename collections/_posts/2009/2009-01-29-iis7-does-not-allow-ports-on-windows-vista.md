After clean installing Windows Vista, Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008 on my
work computer, I started having problems with using dynamic ports with ASP.NET.

When ASP.NET web applications are executed in VS 2005/2008, theyÂ may run on dynamic
ports on the local server, e.g. `localhost:12345`. This worked before the clean install,
but now I found myself being incorrectly redirected to `www.localhost.com:12345`.

After struggling with this, I eventually found a solution [here]({{page.link}}). If
you face the same problems as I did, I hope that it helps you out.
