The earth is moving
The moon is full
The ground is covered with
Unearthed skulls
A mass-grave in silence
From ancient days
A triumph of science
Reverse decay

We dig through the layers of old
Ready to challenge - our maker
Once primates but now has evolved 
Ready to challenge - what’s sacred
A weak species bound by the flesh
Ready to challenge - its limits
A strong species crossing the chasm
Ready to challenge it all

The earth is boiling
The moon is black
The ground is covered with
Those who came back
A triumph of science
Reversed decay
Mankind is entering
Immortal days

All hail the evolution of man
Mankind is on the rise to
Raise the dead

Raise the dead

The earth is boiling
The moon is red
The ground is covered with
The living dead
A massacre of violence
Alive once more
Ready for vengeance
Ready for war

Eating, clawing, biting, carving
Hunting down the last of man
Feeding on what they can find
Feeding just because they can
Fleeing doesn’t help you
When the ones you raised are all around
Feeding on what they can find
Feeding on a race profound

Eating, clawing, biting, carving
Devouring the last of man
Feeding on the ones who raised them
Feeding just because they can
Hiding doesn’t help you
When the ones you raised are all around
Feeding on what they can find
Feeding on a race uncrowned

We hide in the layers of old
Ready to meet - our maker
Once primates now reduced to prey
Ready to meet - what’s waiting
A weak species bound to the fear
Ready to meet - the last limit
A strong species crushed by its strife
Ready to abandon it all

All hail the destruction of man
Mankind is on its knees to
Feed the dead
