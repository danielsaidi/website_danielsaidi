This Øredev 2013 session was a masterpiece, where Shay Friedman blasted through
30 NuGet packages in 50 minutes.

Before I start writing about how perfect this session was, first some background
information. The night before this talk, I went to bed at 2 am after a night out
with my great colleagues from eBay Sweden. To avoid having a day with heavy lids, 
I calculated that going to bed at 2 am would give me 6 hours of sleep. More than
enough (I get by on 4). The perfect plan.

At 5 am, however, I was woken up by the world collapsing. Or so I thought, as I
was violently pulled out of sleep after a mere 3 hours. Looking out of the poorly
isolated window with my heart racing, I saw to two huge machines tearing up the
asphalt right outside my window. The sound was terrible. Then came the jackhammers.

It was a tired Daniel who walked in to Shay's session the next day. As he prepared
the crowd with funny image after funny image after funny random stuff on the web,
I knew that I had chosen the right talk for my current state of vegetable mind. I
don't mean that Shay’s session was trivial. In fact, it was brilliant.

In his talk, Shay built an application from scratch, using NuGet packages to fill
out the blanks. It was nothing less than an excellent demonstration of the power
that comes to those who take a trip to NuGet and fill the cart with already developed
tools. In no time at all, Shay created an app that could interpret six languages, 
export data to various formats, format text, extract video from YouTube etc.

I will not go through all the packages used in the application, but I found the 
Roslyn, Ruby, Python and some JavaScript code runners to be really cool. And
FluentDateTime. And the YouTube video extractor. And ObjectDumper. And Ensure.That.
