Many iOS apps have screens where the header view stretches out when you pull down the screen. In this post, let’s look at how to implement such a header view in SwiftUI.

{% include kankoda/data/open-source name="ScrollKit" %}


## Example

If you are unsure of what kind of view I mean, consider this nice Spotify album screen:

![A Spotify screenshot]({{page.assets}}spotify-demo.jpg)

As you can see, the header stretches out when you pull it down, instead of leaving a gap at the top, then scrolls away with the rest of the content with a nice fade animation.


## How to implement a stretchable scroll view header

Turns out that building a stretchable scroll view header is actually pretty simple, and only requires you to use a `GeometryReader` and apply a `frame` and `offset` to your content view.

We need to define how the view should behave when it's in its original position and how it should resize when we pull it down. We also have to make it ignore the top safe area.

Let's first wrap our content in a `GeometryReader` so that we can use its proxy to get the size and frame of the content:

```swift
GeometryReader { geo in
    content()
        .stretchable(in: geo)
}
```

Let's then define a view extension that we can use to transform the content into a header:

```swift
private extension View {

    @ViewBuilder
    func stretchable(in geo: GeometryProxy) -> some View {
        if geo.frame(in: .global).minY <= 0 {
            // When the view is being scrolled
        } else {
            // When the view is resting or being pulled
        }
    }
}
```

When the view is being scrolled, we actually just want to use the original view. This means that the first part of the if clause can be expressed like this:

```swift
private extension View {

    @ViewBuilder
    func stretchable(in geo: GeometryProxy) -> some View {
        if geo.frame(in: .global).minY <= 0 {
            self
        } else {
            // Set up the view's pulled down behavior
        }
    }
}
```

When the view is pulled down, we want to resize it to cover for the additional space, which is the `minY` position of the geometry proxy, then offset it with the same inverted amount, to get the effect that it sticks to the top and expands at the bottom.

This lets us fill out the second part of the if clause and wrap up the feature altogether:

```swift
extension View {

    @ViewBuilder
    func stretchable(in geo: GeometryProxy) -> some View {
        let width = geo.size.width
        let height = geo.size.height
        let minY = geo.frame(in: .global).minY
        let useStandard = minY <= 0
        self.frame(width: width, height: height + (useStandard ? 0 : minY))
            .offset(y: useStandard ? 0 : -minY)
    }
}
```

We just add the proxy `minY` to the view height and adjust the vertical offset with the same amount. This will account for the safe area, which means we don't have to do it separately.

This is actually all we have to do to create a stretchable scroll view header. Put it topmost in a scroll view, and it will automatically expand when you pull down on it.


## Creating a new scroll view header component

Since we must always use a `GeometryReader` and a view modifier for this to work, I find it convenient to have a separate scroll view header view that does all of this:

```swift
public struct ScrollViewHeader<Content: View>: View {

    public init(
        @ViewBuilder content: @escaping () -> Content
    ) {
        self.content = content
    }

    private let content: () -> Content

    public var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { geo in
            content().stretchable(in: geo)
        }
    }
}

private extension View {

    @ViewBuilder
    func stretchable(in geo: GeometryProxy) -> some View {
        let width = geo.size.width
        let height = geo.size.height
        let minY = geo.frame(in: .global).minY
        let useStandard = minY <= 0
        self.frame(width: width, height: height + (useStandard ? 0 : minY))
            .offset(y: useStandard ? 0 : -minY)
    }
}
```

You can now use a `ScrollViewHeader` instead of having to add a `GeometryReader` to the scroll view and apply a view modifier to the scroll view content.



## Implementing the album screen

Let's put this header view to the test by implementing a test screen that mimics the Spotify album screen we saw at the beginning of this post.

The screen should use dark mode and have a header that fades from brown to black. The header should be stretchable and have a cover that expands when it's pulled down.

Let's start with defining the screen:

```swift
struct AlbumScreen: View {

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            ScrollView {
                header
                content
            }
        }
        .accentColor(.white)
        .colorScheme(.dark)
    }
}
```

The `header` view is a `ScrollViewHeader` with a gradient background and an `AsyncImage` that fetches the image from a remote url:

```
var header: some View {
    ScrollViewHeader {
        ZStack {
            LinearGradient(
                colors: [.brown, .black],
                startPoint: .top,
                endPoint: .bottom
            )
            AsyncImage(
                url: URL(string: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/AnthraxWCFYA.jpg"),
                content: { image in
                    image.image?.resizable()
                        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
                }
            )
            .aspectRatio(1, contentMode: .fit)
            .cornerRadius(5)
            .shadow(radius: 10)
            .padding(.top, 60)
            .padding(.horizontal, 20)
        }
    }
    .frame(height: 280)
}
```

We also apply a fixed height to the header, and specifies native constraints to the image, to make sure that it's a rounded square with a a drop shadow and some edge padding.

The content view is just a `VStack` with some padding and the rest of the scrollable content:

```swift
var content: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 20) {
        title
        buttons
        list
    }
    .padding()
}
```

The title view is just a `VStack` with some stylized text:

```swift
var title: some View {
    VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) {
        Text("We've Come for You All")
            .font(.title2.bold())
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
        Text("Anthrax")
            .font(.footnote.bold())
        Text("Album · 2003")
            .font(.footnote.bold())
            .foregroundColor(.secondary)
    }
}
```

The buttons view is just an `HStack` with some icons:

```swift
var buttons: some View {
    HStack(spacing: 15) {
        Image(systemName: "heart")
        Image(systemName: "arrow.down.circle")
        Image(systemName: "ellipsis")
        Spacer()
        Image(systemName: "shuffle")
        Image(systemName: "play.circle.fill")
            .font(.largeTitle)
            .foregroundColor(.green)
    }
    .font(.title3)
}
```

And finally, the list view is just a `LazyVStack` with some dummy items:

```swift
var list: some View {
    LazyVStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 30) {
        listItem("Contact")
        listItem("What Doesn't Die")
        listItem("Superhero")
        listItem("Refuse to Be Denied")
        listItem("Safe Home")
        listItem("Any Place But Here")
        listItem("Nobody Knows Anything")
    }
}

func listItem(_ song: String) -> some View {
    VStack(alignment: .leading) {
        Text(song).font(.headline)
        Text("Anthrax")
            .font(.footnote)
            .foregroundColor(.secondary)
    }
}
```

Put all this together and you get a screen that looks like the Spotify album screen, where the header stretches out when you pull down, then scrolls with the rest of the content:

![A SwiftUI preview that mimics the Spotify album screen]({{page.assets}}app-demo.jpg)

Although this is already nice, there are some things you must consider when creating this kind of header, since it doesn't play well together with the standard navigation view.


## Things to consider

When you use this kind of stretchable header together with a native `NavigationView`, there are a few things that you should consider.

First, don't use `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.large)` since it adds a large title. You can instead cross fade from a custom header to an inline title when the header scrolls away.

You should also consider using `toolbarBackground(.hidden)` or a UIKit workaround on iOS versions before iOS 16, to make the navigation bar transparent while the header is visible. 

The Spotify app will actually make the header stick to the top when it reaches the size of the navigation bar. I will show you how to build this in an upcoming post.

Finally, make sure to set up the status bar and navigation title to play well with the header. You can use the [scroll offset]({{page.post-offset}}) to determine how to style the header.


## Conclusion

The `ScrollViewHeader` presented in this post lets you add stretchable headers to a scroll view by just adding your content to this header component.

I have added this view to my newly released [ScrollKit]({{project.url}}) library. You can find the source code [here]({{project.url}}{{page.source}}). If you give it a try, I'd love to hear what you think.

Big thanks to [Daniel Arden]({{page.arden}}) for joining my efforts to extend the native SwiftUI `ScrollView` with these great features.
