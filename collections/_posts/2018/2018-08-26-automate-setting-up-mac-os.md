In this post, I'll describe how to automate setting up a new Mac with a
terminal script that will install system software and applications, configure
the computer etc. This lets you setup a new Mac in minutes.


## Why automate?

I (and many with me) prefer to automate as many tasks as possible, to reduce the
amount of repetitive manual work, reduce the risk of human error and to increase
the overall reliability of a certain process. 

For good developers, this involves unit testing, continuous integration, release 
management etc. while for testers it can involve automated UI testing etc.

However, one thing that I haven't automated until recently, is to setup a brand
new Mac for development, which is time consuming and just not fun. It's tedious
to remember all the tools and applications that you need. Without automation, it
can easily take a day, with you filling out gaps for weeks.

With automation, however, you can setup a new Mac in minutes, making the time it
takes time linear to the speed of your Internet connection.


## Tools on which I base my script

Before I show you the script that I have put together to solve this problem, let
me go through some tools that I base the script on. They are great and will
simplify your life, so make sure to check them out.

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager (one of several) for macOS.
It makes it super easy to install new system tools on your Mac.
* [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) is a brew extension
that lets you install Mac applications directly from the Terminal.
* [Brew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) is a brew extension
that lets you manage brew and cask packages with a `Brewfile`.
* [Gem](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) is a package manager for Ruby-based
software, e.g. Fastlane.
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) is a package manager for web-development software.
I also use it for hybrid apps.

My script will first install these tools, then install everything else using the
tools as well as other scripts.


## Creating the script

Let's create the main system script. It will be modular, to make it easy to adjust
over time when needed.

First, create a file called `setup.sh` and add the following code to it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  if [[ $# == 0 ]]; then
    printf "\n\n***** Setup *****\n\n"

    printf "Available commands:\n\n"
    printf "\n"
    printf "      all:  Install everything\n"
    printf "     brew:  Install packages & apps from Brewfile\n"
    printf "   config:  Configure macOS\n"
    printf "      gem:  Install packages from Gemfile\n"
    printf "      npm:  Install npm packages from scripts/npm.sh\n"
    printf "      ssh:  Create & copy SSH key\n"
    printf "   system:  Install system software\n"
    printf "\n"
    printf "        q:  Quit/Exit.\n"
    printf "\n\n"

    read -p "Enter option: " response
    printf "\n"
    process_option $response
  else
    process_option $1
  fi
done
```

This prints a "main menu" with various options. As you can see, I have split it 
into several modules, with an `all` option that installs everything.

The script above lacks the `process_options` function that it refers to. Add the
following code snippet above `while true`:


```bash
process_option() {
  case $1 in
    'all')
      source scripts/config.sh
      source scripts/system.sh
      source scripts/apps.sh
      source scripts/npm.sh
      source scripts/fastlane.sh
      source scripts/ssh.sh
      break;;
    'apps')
      source scripts/apps.sh
      break;;
    'config')
      source scripts/config.sh
      break;;
    'fastlane')
      source scripts/fastlane.sh
      break;;
    'npm')
      source scripts/npm.sh
      break;;
    'ssh')
      source scripts/ssh.sh
      break;;
    'system')
      source scripts/system.sh
      break;;
      
    'q')
      break;;
    *)
      break;;
  esac
}
```

Here, each option just calls another script in the `scripts` folder or runs a
terminal command, where each external file is very simple. The `Brewfile`
contains brew and cask dependencies, the `Gemfile` gem dependencies and the script
files commands that you could type manually in the terminal.

Have a look at some examples from each file:


```bash
// scripts/system.sh

if ! command -v brew > /dev/null; then
    printf "[SYSTEM] Install Homebrew\n"
    ruby -e "$(curl --location --fail --silent --show-error https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
else
    printf "[SYSTEM] Update Homebrew\n"
    brew update
fi
printf "\n"

printf "[SYSTEM] Install Cask\n"
brew tap caskroom/cask
printf "\n"

...
```

```bash
// scripts/config.sh

printf "[CONFIG] Finder, Show hidden files\n"
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true
killall Finder -9
printf "\n"
```

```bash
// scripts/npm.sh

printf "[NPM] Installing TypeScript\n"
sudo npm install -g typescript
printf "\n"
```


```bash
// scripts/ssh.sh

read -p "[SSH] Create new SSH key (yes/no): " response
if test "$response" = "yes"; then
	printf "\n"
	read -p "Enter your e-mail: " ssh_email
	printf "\n"
    printf "[SSH] Creating ssh key\n"
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C $ssh_email
fi
printf "\n"

printf "[SSH] Adding ssh key to ssh-agent\n"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
printf "\n"

printf "[SSH] Copying ssh key to pasteboard\n"
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

printf "[SSH] Done\n"
printf "\n"
```


```bash
// Brewfile

cask_args appdir: "/Applications"

brew "mas"
cask "android-studio"
...
```


```bash
// Gemfile

# frozen_string_literal: true
source "https://rubygems.org"
git_source(:github) {|repo_name| "https://github.com/#{repo_name}" }
gem 'cocoapods'
...
```


## Result

If I run the `all` option, it will take care of the following:

* Configuring OS X
* Installing package managers (Homebrew, Cask, RubyGems, NPM)
* Installing brew packages (Carthage, SwiftGen, SwiftLint etc.)
* Installing Mac applications (Chrome, Slack, Sketch etc.)
* Installing gem packages (CocoaPods, Fastlane, Jekyll etc.)
* Installing npm packages (Ionic, Gulp, TypeScript etc.)
* Setting up SSH (create a key, add to ssh-agent, copy to pasteboard)

Doing this manually would take me a couple of hours every time. Now, it finishes
in a matter of minutes.


## Download

I have a GitHub repo that you can fork and tweak to fit your needs. You can find
it [here](https://github.com/danielsaidi/osx). Hopefully, it will save you a lot
of time, as it have for me.
