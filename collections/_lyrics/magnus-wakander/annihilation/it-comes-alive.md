I enter waters
Where sickness flows
Waiting in the darkness 
For the hunger to grow
I hide in sewers
Where no one knows

It’s never too late 
To give in and grab your boat
It’s never too late 
To give up and start to float

I enter nightmares
Where madness grows
Waiting for the time to shine
That's when I’ll show
I then hide in plain sight
Still no one knows

It’s never too late 
To give in to the pain
It’s never too late 
To give up and go insane

It hides for a generation’s grief
It thrives in the fear it makes us feel
It comes alive when it’s time to feed

It smiles and turns into a scream
It bites through the thousand rows of teeth
It shines and the light is what it is

It’s never too late
To give in to defeat
It’s never too late
To give up and let me feed

It hides for a generation’s grief
It thrives in the fear it makes us feel
It comes alive when it’s time to feed
