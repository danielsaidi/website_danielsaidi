The end
It’s time
To say
Goodbye

This is the end of the line
This is the end of a life

Once full
Now dry
Hollow
Inside

I’ve aged out of this life
I’ve aged too tired to try

Worn out
Consumed
Dried up
No fumes

I’m just wasting your time
I’m just wasting this life

Once young
Now old
All tales
Now told

It’s time to exit this life
It’s time to enter the night

I worn my soul too thin
Nothing remains within
The well is broken and dry
No need to even try
I’ve lost the will, the way
There’s nothing left to say
Except a final goodbye
The end of a life

The end
No tears
No regrets
No fear

It’s just a final sigh
It’s just a final goodbye

Once strong
Now weak
Once vivid
Now bleak

I dried up over time
Now grey and barely alive

I dreamt too big for too long
Now no dreams remain
So much hope wasted on this
Sorry excuse of a man
I’ve lost the little I had
There’s nothing left to claim
Except a final goodbye
The end of a life

I hoped too much for too long
Now no hope longer remains

The end
Of me
You will
Be free

No longer wasting your time
No longer wasting your life

The end
It’s time
To say
Goodbye

This is the end of the line
This is the end of a life

So much air wasted on this
Sorry excuse of a man
I’ve lost the little I had
There’s nothing left to claim
Except a final goodbye
The end of a life
This is my final goodbye
The end of a life
