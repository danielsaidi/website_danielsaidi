If I haven't written for a while, something may have happened; an accident or something else. Since I prefer to be well-prepared, here are some final words in case they're needed.

Writing my final words on a blog may be a bit pretentious, but hey - let's call it being well prepared!


## Life

Most of you who read this post are probably here for the tech content. I'd be surprised if this was not the case, since this is what this website is all about. Wonderful technology and beautiful code.

However, there are some aspects of life that I'd love to touch upon, and send some words to those who may still be around, given that the cause for this post was not a big-ass meteror striking earth.

(But that would render this whole post and all scheduling challenges it involved utterly pointless.)

To my family - Johanna, Cornelia and Lovisa - I can't express in words how much I love you and what you mean to me. I will always love you to the stars and back. Thank you for making life wonderful!

The same to my mom and dad - Ingrid and Sasan, my brothers Sebastian and Patrick, my niece Julia and family-in law: Gunvor, Sture, Karin, Lars, Theo, Rasmus, Berit, SÃ¶ren, Lilian & Kjell - love you all!


## Music

Besides tech, let me plug some [music]({{page.music}}). Make sure to listen to my latest album [Inferno]({{page.inferno}}), that I made with Magnus Wakander. If I'm to die at a (semi)young age, let's at least make it as famous as Mozart.

Big thanks to [Misfortune]({{page.bands}}misfortune) for being my first musical family, to [New Wave Stoner / x:o / sgt. Black]({{page.bands}}sgt-black) for becoming a new family in a new home town, and to [Kollektivet]({{page.bands}}kollektivet) for taking on and improving my C G Am F creations and for humoring my song-writing ambitions.

For the songs that are not yet up on any streaming services, please reach out to my wife Johanna and request that she publishes my many unpublished demos that I have. But not before carefully mastering and polishing each song to perfection. I'm sure you can make it happen!


## Open-source

In the case of my demise, take good care of my various [open-source projects]({/opensource). Fork them, nurture them and keep them shiny. Kill them with fire if they start to misbehave.


## Commercial Software

If you're a KeyboardKit Pro Enterprise customer with Escrow Services in your agreement, reach out to Code Keeper. to access the source code as soon as my company goes out of business.

If you're a KeyboardKit user or customer without Escrow Services, I hope the SDK stays stable long enough for you to be able to find something new.

If my wife decides to keep the software running, she will keep my Kankoda company running, which means that you can reach out to her for future needs.


## Conclusion

I hope that this post never goes live. If it does, it has been nice to have you as a reader. Sorry for the morbid tone in this post. I guess it comes with growing up in the ironic 90's. 

I'll try to do better in my next life.

Love,
Daniel Saidi
