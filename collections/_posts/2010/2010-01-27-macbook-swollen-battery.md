I have previously written about my numerous problems with my new, white MacBook,
which I purchased in August 2007. As icing on the case the battery has now swollen.

My MacBook is absolutely amazing, and I am so happy to have left the PC world for
Apple. However, I am very disappointed with the MacBook's build quality. For instance:

* The fan roared like crazy and required service.
* The audio port shone with a red light and acted as an optical device was connected.
* The audio port optical mode turned of all sounds from the internal speakers.
* The plastic chassi cracked(!).
* The color wheel of death appeared every now and then, freezing the computer.
* The computer stopped waking up from sleep.
* The computer stopped recognizing my hard drive and displayed a ? when booting up.

Fortunately, I documented all these problems while they were happening and wrote a
long issue report. The support person I sent the computer to doubted that I would
get the errors accepted as a reclamation, but as I handed him the report, he said
that it improved my chances drastically.

And so it did. I got the computed repaired, and after that, it has worked like a charm.
That is, until the battery decided to swell. I didn't notice it at first, but after a
small bump, it quickly became worse.

Before I knew it, the battery was very swollen. Apple did NOT accept this complaint,
so I had to buy a new battery. I luckily found a reseller that sold unofficial batteries
for half the price, but the damage to the computer was already done.

I will write about this in the next entry...the green/orange color toggle problem.
