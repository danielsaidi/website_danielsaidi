Follow you
==========

Baby I have seen you
read between the lines
Looking for a way out
looking for a lie

But baby I've been scared
for large parts of my lives
But I have found my place here
feaefaewgaew

Baby can you see
what you do to me?
Whenever I am near you
I turn into a freak
vaavewaew
and even if you're near
I won't take your hand
I won't follow you anywhere

But you won't quit that easily
You've made up your mind
I am gonna be yours
and baby, you'll be mine

But I won't share your eyes, babe
And I won't share your spite
If you believe that people equal lies
you'll never sleep another night



Baby can't you see
what you do to me?
Whenever I am near you
I turn into a freak
Cause baby, you are scared
even when I'm near
that I won't take your hand
that I won't follow you anywhere

Baby can't you see
what you mean to me?
Without you I am nothing
still, without you I am free

Baby I am scared,
that even if you're near
I won't take your hand
I won't follow you anywhere
