I gave this talk at [{{page.location}}]({{page.location-url}}) in Oct 2022, on how to build a great documentation experience with DocC.

The talk guides the audience through the DocC documentation tool and how to use it for code documentation, articles, tutorials, etc. 

The talk also shows how to use DocC specific widgets and publish the result to GitHub Pages.
