I'm currently getting started with Android development, which means that I have
a lot of new stuff to memorize. It's so obvious that the biggest challenge with
learning a new language is not the syntax itself, but the tools and conventions.
Let's look at some acronyms that are worth remembering.

Below is a list of some Android acronyms that I have stumbled upon while reading
the Android Developer Guidelines:

* AAPT - Android Asset Packaging Tool
* ADB - Android Debug Bridge (enables debugging on emulator or device)
* ADK - Accessory Development Kit
* ADM - Android Debug Monitor
* ADT - Android Developer Tools
* AIDL - Android Interface Definition Language
* ANT - Another Neat Tool (build tool)
* APK - Android Application Package (like an .msi file)
* AVD - Android Virtual Device
* BMGR - Backup Manager
* CAB - Contextual Action Bar
* DDMS - Dalvik Debug Monitor Service
* DEX - Dalvik Executable
* DVM - Dalvik Virtual Machine
* GPB - Google Play Billing (like iOS IAP)
* JDWP - Java Debug Wire Protocol
* MMU - Memory-management unit
* NDK - Native Development Toolkit

If you, like me, is an Android n00b, I really recommend reading through the
[Android knowledge base](http://developer.android.com).
