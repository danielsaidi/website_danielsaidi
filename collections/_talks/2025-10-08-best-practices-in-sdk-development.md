abstract: |  
  Modern software increasingly relies on open-source and commercial, closed-source libraries, yet creating a maintainable, developer-friendly SDK remains a challenge.

  This talk delves into best practices that differentiate great SDKs from good ones, and explores many critical aspects of SDK development. We'll look at how to design intuitive APIs and structure the API surface for discoverability, and how to create a system design that scales over time, with tests that ensure SDK and API reliability. We'll also cover DocC, semantic versioning, and deprecations.

  Whether you're maintaining an existing SDK or planning a new one, you'll walk away with insights to create SDKs that developers trust and enjoy using.
