For years, I've been struggling with combining generics and protocols in Swift. In this post, I'll describe how I finally made sense of it all.


## The problem with generic protocols

I use protocols extensively and often have a need for generic protocols. However, I often run into problems that have ended up with applying a non-generic approach.

For instance, when I built a set of generic stores, I started with describing the various types stores as generic protocols with associated types:

```swift
protocol ObjectStore {
    
    func deleteContent()
}

protocol SingleObjectStore: ObjectStore {
    
    associatedtype ObjectType
    
    func getObject() -> ObjectType?
    func store(_ object: ObjectType)
}
```

The real stores are a bit different, but let's keep it simple. With these protocols in place, I then created implemenations that used `typealias` to specify the associated types.

Everything went great. I was really happy about finally being able to replace all old stores with these generic ones. So I tried to do just that, by creating a store property in my app.

If you want to create an `ObjectStore`, you specify it just as you would with any other type:

```swift
var store: ObjectStore
```

However, the same is not true for the generic `SingleObjectStore`:

```swift
var store: SingleObjectStore
```

This fails to compile with this error message: `Protocol 'SingleObjectStore' can only be used as a generic constraint because it has Self or associated type requirements`.

If you try to solve it like this:

```swift
var store: SingleObjectStore<Int>
```

you will see another error: `Cannot specialize non-generic type 'SingleObjectStore'`.

So, how do you fix this? My solution has always been to turn to non-generic protocols (but that's not a solution, that's defeat) or...type erasure.


## Type erasure

Type erasure means using concrete types to wrap generic protocols. However, I never got it to work, mostly because it seems like a way to work around Swift's type system.

This time, however, I was determined to make things work, and actually managed to do so. Let's see how, using simplified versions of the protocols I built.


## A working example

Let's go back to our stores, where `SingleObjectStore` is intended to store a single object:

```swift
protocol ObjectStore {
    
    func deleteContent()
}

protocol SingleObjectStore: ObjectStore {
    
    associatedtype ObjectType
    
    func getObject() -> ObjectType?
    func store(_ object: ObjectType)
}
```

Let's create a simple single object store that stores codable objects in user defaults:

```swift
class CodableSingleObjectStore<ObjectType: Codable>: SingleObjectStore {
    
    init(storageKey: String) {
        self.storageKey = storageKey
    }
    
    let storageKey: String
    
    var defaults: UserDefaults {
        return .standard
    }
    
    func deleteContent() {
        defaults.removeObject(forKey: storageKey)
    }
    
    func getObject() -> ObjectType? {
        guard let data = defaults.data(forKey: storageKey) else { return nil }
        return try? JSONDecoder().decode(ObjectType.self, from: data)
    }
    
    func store(_ object: ObjectType) {
        guard let encoded = try? JSONEncoder().encode(object) else { return }
        defaults.set(encoded, forKey: storageKey)
    }
}
```

To create a concrete instance of this type, we just have to do this:

```swift
var store: CodableSingleObjectStore<MyType>
...
store = CodableSingleObjectStore<MyType>(storageKey: "key")
```

However, this still doesn't work...and never will, at least not in Swift 5:

```swift
var store: SingleObjectStore
...
store = CodableSingleObjectStore<MyType>(storageKey: "key")
```

We *could* use `CodableSingleObjectStore`, but dependencies to conrete types is not a good thing to have in your code.

At the same time, we can't have dependencies to the abstract protocol, due to the reasons already discussed...so how do we do this?

This is where type erasure comes in, where we can let concrete types wrap abstract ones, then use the wrappers everywhere instead of the protocol.

The Swift naming convention for these type erasured types is to prefix the class name with `AnyX`, so we'd be creating a type erasured single object store like this:

```swift
class AnySingleObjectStore<ObjectType>: SingleObjectStore {
    
    init<T: SingleObjectStore>(_ store: T) where T.ObjectType == ObjectType {
        self.deleteContentClosure = store.deleteContent
        self.getObjectClosure = store.getObject
        self.storeObjectClosure = store.store
    }
    
    let deleteContentClosure: () -> ()
    let getObjectClosure: () -> (ObjectType?)
    let storeObjectClosure: (ObjectType) -> ()
    
    func deleteContent() {
        deleteContentClosure()
    }
    
    func getObject() -> ObjectType? {
        return getObjectClosure()
    }
    
    func store(_ object: ObjectType) {
        storeObjectClosure(object)
    }
}
```

To create instances of this type, using the codable store we created earlier, we can do this:

```swift
var store: AnySingleObjectStore<MyType>
...
store = AnySingleObjectStore(CodableSingleObjectStore<MyType>(storageKey: "key"))
```

The `AnySingleObjectStore` object type is used to ensure that we don't inject a store with a different type, which means that we can be sure that we store the correct type in our store.


## Conclusion

Type erasure is still nasty, but this approach gets the job done. If you have ideas on how to get rid of the closures in `AnySingleObjectStore`, I'd love to hear them.

The generic constraints will hopefully change in a future Swift version, so that type erasure is either implicitly implemented by the compiler, or removed altogether.
