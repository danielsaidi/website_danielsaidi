I sang in sgt. Black 2001-2004. During this time, we changed name and lineup twice. The first lineup (New Wave Stoner) wrote many songs, but recorded none. The second (x:o) made a 7 track demo.

The final lineup (sgt. Black) was the same as x:o, with a slight change of musical direction. We wrote a bunch of songs, and recorded 9. They are still waiting to be released.
