Deep Dish Swift Day 1 was one afternoon filled with amazing talks and getting the chance to meet many people from the community, ending with a deep dish at Giordano's. Let's get Day 2 going.

## Peter Steinberger

### Opening Keynote - There And Back Again

[Peter]({{page.peter}}) from PSPDFKit talked about how he sold his company, and how the last two years have been the hardest in his life.

This talk was not a success story, rather the opposite. It was a many-faceted, and deeply touching description about what it's like to start a company, reach success and start to grow, then feeling the loss of control as more people are brought in, having to battle with separating your identity from your company and product, conflicts, burning out etc. 

Eventually, selling the company that you've identified with for so long can have some nasty surprises. Who are you when no longer have that large part of who you consider yourself to be? Who are you in that deep void, when you have no sense of purpose? This talk went deep and dark, but ended with insights on how to cope and find yourself again.

I loved it.

### Algorithms: Where No Developer Wants To Go

[Daniela]({{page.daniela}}) followed up Peter's keynote with a fun and insightful talk on algorithms, and how the Swift standard library has algorithms that can help make your code faster, better and more concise.

Daniela showed how to use and chain many of the standard library algorithms like `map`, `compactMap` and `flatMap` and also demoed a few that can be found in the Swift Algorithms package. It was heavy on code, so I will not try to summarize it, but whether you are an experienced Swift developer or just started learning, this is a great and very fun watch.


## Ben Scheirman

### Algorithms: Modular Architecture with Swift

[Ben]({{page.ben}}) talked about modular architecture, and the importance of understanding the impact of dependencies and some tools and approaches to make it all work.

This talk was fun and went through many important parts of modularized software in great detail. Having focused much of my work life on these kind of challenges, there was little new for me personally. If you're interested in system design, modularization etc. it's a must.



## Via Fairchild

### What is mentorship and why youâ€™re ready to be a mentor

[Via]({{page.via}}) talked about her life as a single mother, trying to make ends meet, and how a single friend in the world of iOS development helped her change her life by transitioning to tech.

Via's story was personal and touching, and she took great care in thanking all the amazing people in this community who have helped out along the way. As a seasoned developer, it's easy to forget the early days and how important role models, mentors, and the helping hands truly are. Thank you for reminding me, Via!



## Marc Aupont

### Unlocking the Power of Swift Playgrounds

[Marc]({{page.marc}}) started talking about his life and developer journey. He's seen how everyone has the power to create, but are the tools accessible? Getting a MacBook to start developing and an iPhone to test what you create is a pretty steep hill to climb for some.

From this perspective, the iPad and Swift Playgrounds is a groundbreaking alternative that lets you develop in Swift on even the most basics of iPad models, trying what you build on the same device. It's not only more accessible when it comes to price, is a much less tech heavy setup, which opens up the world of development to even more people.

Marc demonstrated how to create, share and distribute a Swift Playground Book. I didn't know about this concept nor the Swift Playground Book Store, but it looks really cool! With this and many great features like being able to drag code from code examples into the source code area, Apple seems to have created a very powerful and accessible tool.



## Vui Nguyen

### Make Porting Custom SwiftUI Design Elements Easy With Swift Packages

[Viu]({{page.viu}}) talked about how to use a local package structure to provide things like custom colors and fonts and let you apply them as you would with the native colors and fonts. 

As I've basically lived and breathed Swift Packages for many years now, I wasn't the target audience, but if you are new to Swift Packages, there are many useful insights here.
