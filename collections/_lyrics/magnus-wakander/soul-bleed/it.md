I enter waters
Where sickness flows
Waiting in the darkness
For the hunger to grow
I hide in sewers
Where no one knows

It’s never too late to give in 
And grab your boat
It’s never too late to give up 
And start to float

I enter nightmares
Where madness grows
Waiting for the time to shine
That's when I’ll show
I leave clues in plain sight
Still no one knows

It’s never too late to give in
To the pain
It’s never too late to give up
And go insane

It hides 
For a generation’s grief
It comes alive
When it’s time to feed
It thrives 
In the fear it makes us feel

It smiles 
And turns into a scream
It bites 
Through the thousand rows of teeth
It shines 
And the light is what it is

It’s never too late to give in
To defeat
It’s never too late to give up 
And let me feed

It hides 
For a generation’s grief
It comes alive
When it’s time to feed
It thrives 
In the fear it makes us feel
