Tradera is a Swedish classified marketplace, previously owned by [eBay]({{page.ebay}}) & [PayPay]({{page.paypal}}), where people can bid on auction items and buy fixed-prices.

I joined Tradera as a backend developer, then became responsible for bringing the iOS & Android apps back from an external agency, then build new ones.

The goal with the new app versions was to create hybrid apps that could reuse as much as possible from the new, responsive web.

To solve this, I created a hybrid framework for both platforms, that ran in native apps with a bidirectional configuration engine, to let the web configure the app and vice versa.

The apps also had native features, like local reminders, push notifications and deep links.
