Anomaly Software is an Australian-based tech-company that hired me for keyboard-related work and sponsored my [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) open source project.

One of Anomaly's custom keyboards has a custom autocomplete engine that provides translations between various indigenous languages. It was really cool to see KeyboardKit be used to bring people together, overcoming language barriers.

Thanks to Anomaly Software, KeyboardKit has improved support for autocomplete, which is a feature that later became one of the first Pro features for the commercial Keyboard Pro license. 

Big thanks to Anomaly Software for sponsporing KeyboardKit and my overall work!
