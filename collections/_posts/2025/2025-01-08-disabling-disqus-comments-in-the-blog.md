As the enshittification of the Internet continues, I just noticed how Disqus has started to bombard the blog comment section with horrible ads. As such, I will remove Disqus comments from the blog.

I have used Disqus for many years, and it has been very stable. I also understand that services need to make money, but the way that Disqus did this leaves me no choice but to immediately remove it.

Without any notice before enabling these ads, this is what my blog suddenly looked like:

Nothing screams premium like nails, sickness, disease, clogged drains, and disgusting bathrooms.

It's also "fun" how Disqus picks these disgusting ads for a site that is configured as "tech" content:

So I guess this is bye, bye. As the world (well, mostly the U.S.) keeps enshittening most of public life (Internet, movies, music, food, politics, etc.) I'd love for EU to offer alternatives.

But while I'd love to see an EU that empoweres and encourages local innovation as an alternative, I guess I'll have to do with increasing bureaucracy and regulations.


## What now?

With Disqus gone, I'll link to Twitter and Mastodon as ways to discus my various blog posts. You can also ping me directly if you want to discuss anything I write.
