I've been trying out Twitter and Jaiku for a while now. Since both provide more
or less the same set of features, I have evaluated which I think will best fit
my needs going forward.

First of all, Twitter crushes Jaiku when it comes to Facebook integration. During
my tests, Twitter posted each update instantly, while Jaiku only posted 1/3 with
a noticable delay.

Second, a big reason that made me try Jaiku, was its ability to hook itself into
varios RSS feeds. With that feature now gone, I see no point in keeping the two
streams alive simultaneously.

So, I've decided to go with Twitter. If you think Jaiku has an ace up its sleeve,
let me know asap.
