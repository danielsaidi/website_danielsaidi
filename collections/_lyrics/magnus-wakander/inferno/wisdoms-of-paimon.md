Through his hand, the aim
Through his lips, the truth
Through his eyes, the light
Through us, he reigns

Paimon
Spirit King
His wisdom guides us
To the end

He guards the gates of knowledge
Shares his wisdom through the pledge
He sees the past, the future, the present
Through the mists of wisdoms ancient

Through our hands, his reach
Through our lips, his chant
Through our eyes, his gaze
Through him, we reign

Through your hands, the nails
Through your lips, the lies
Through your eyes, the thorns
Through you, he reigns

Paimon
Spirit King
His wisdom guides us
Through the end

Paimon

He guards the gates of knowledge
Shares his wisdom through the pledge
He sees the past, the future, the present
Through the mists of wisdoms ancient

He guards the gates of knowledge
Shares his wisdom through the pledge
He sees the past, the future, the present
Through the mists of wisdoms ancient

Paimon
Spirit King
Your wisdom guides us
Past the end
