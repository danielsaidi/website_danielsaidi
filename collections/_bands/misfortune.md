I sang in Misfortune between 1995 and 1999. We started off as a Pantera-influenced band, but soon pivoted to the sounds of bands like At the Gates, Carcass & Dissection.

Our second demo "Midnightenlightened" got great reviews and was released as an EP by Blackened. We released a full-length album ["Forsaken"]({{page.forsaken}}) in 1999. You can find both on Spotify.
