Each time I open a WPF project in Visual Studio (2010) and open a XAML file,
my computer switches from the semi-transparent theme to Windows 7 Basic.

If this does happen to you too, this is how to solve it:

- In the main menu, select “Tools/Options”.
- Under “Environment/General”, uncheck “Automatically adjust…” and “Use hardware acceleration…”.
- Enjoy the Windows 7 flashy theme 🙂

Easy, right? Rumors says that R# is causing this issue, but I do love JetBrains
and their God-like skills way too much to even consider that to be true.
