As the Swedish summer keeps delivering sun, heat and happiness to this otherwise dark and cold part of the world, I'm going on vacation and will be back in August.

As I decided to start blogging again after some slow years, I found the writing process to be very fun and rewarding. I've aimed for three article per week, which has been a nice way to establish this new habit. Three articles per week however makes it hard to find time to dig deep, so we'll see if I scale down the number of articles in the future, to allow me to spend more time on each article.

A summer break will give me some time to reflect and catch up on other projects. I'll be back in August. See you then!
