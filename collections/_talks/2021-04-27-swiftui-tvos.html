abstract: |
  I gave this workshop at the try! Swift World online workshop
  conference 2021. In the workshop we look at how to build a
  video streaming app for tvOS, using SwiftUI and Combine. We
  create an app that lists movies in shelves and grids and a
  movie detail page that lets us watch the movie and mark it
  as a favorite. We will look at current SwiftUI performance
  problems on tvOS and how to work around them.

  In this workshop, we will look at how to build a video streaming app for tvOS, using SwiftUI and Combine. We will create an app that lists movies in shelves and grids and a movie detail page that lets us watch a trailer and mark the movie as a favorite. We will look at current SwiftUI performance problems on tvOS and how to work around them.

  If time permits, we will use the general tools that we create to create a quick app for iOS as well. We will use SwiftUI 2, so make sure to have the latest version of Xcode if you want to code along.

  ## In this workshop
  * Build a tvOS app in SwiftUI

</section>

<section data-markdown class="image-section" data-background="{{assets}}bg.jpg">
  ## API
  * OMDb - http://omdbapi.com
  * Very easy to integrate with
  * But lacks important information
  * Therefore, a pretty basic app
  * Simplicity to focus on SwiftUI
</section>

<section data-markdown class="image-section" data-background="{{assets}}bg.jpg">
  ## App Screens
  * Discover - List movies by year
  * Favorites - List favorite movies
  * Search - Free text search
  * Movie - Movie details + actions
  * Movie Player - Streams any video url
</section>

<section data-markdown class="image-section" data-background="{{assets}}bg.jpg">
  ## SwiftUI + tvOS Limitations
  * Various glitches, e.g. text field
  * Styling, e.g. buttons and text fields
  * Missing components, e.g. search field
  * Focus engine behavior
  * Bad performance in stacks and grids
