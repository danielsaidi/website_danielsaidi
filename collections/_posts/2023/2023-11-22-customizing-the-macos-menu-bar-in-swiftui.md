In this post, we'll take a look at how to customize the menu bar of a macOS app, using SwiftUI tools like `CommandMenu` and `CommandGroup`.

For more information about customizing the macOS menu bar, I have also written a post about [how to customize the macOS about panel in SwiftUI]({{page.related_post}}).

## Background

Although SwiftUI makes it easier to build multi-platform apps, you will face many platform-specific challenges for each unique platform. For macOS, one such thing is how to customize the menu bar.

SwiftUI makes a good job of keeping this simple, with the use of commands. Let's take a look at how we can use commands to add, remove and replace items in the main menu.


## How to customize the macOS menu bar

Let's start with creating a new app in Xcode. If you pick a Multiplatform App or Document App, it will automatically use SwiftUI and target many platforms:

![Xcode's new project window]({{page.assets}}/new-app.jpg)

If we run this app on macOS without customizations, the standard menu will look like this:

![The standard macOS main menu]({{page.assets}}/standard-menu.png)

We can easily add more top-level menu items or modify items in the standard menus, by applying a SwiftUI `.commands` modifier to the `WindowGroup`:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            // ... custom content here
        }
    }
}
```

This works on both iOS and macOS, so you don't have to use `#if os(macOS)` to only use it on macOS.


## How to add menu items to the menu bar

To add new menu items to the main menu, just add `CommandMenu` items to the `.commands` modifier:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            CommandMenu("Custom") {
                Button("Item 1") {}
                Divider()
                Button("Item 2") {}
            }
            CommandMenu("Another one") {
                Button("Item 3") {}
                Divider()
                Button("Item 4") {}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

These custom menu items will be added in order, after the standard `Views` menu item:

![A custom macOS main menu]({{page.assets}}/custom-menu.png)

The content are regular SwiftUI views, which means that you can add anything you want to a menu:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            CommandMenu("Custom") {
                Color.red
                TextField("Test", text: .constant(""))
                Image(systemName: "face.smiling")
                    .font(.largeTitle)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

However, although the code above compiles, the macOS app will only render supported view types:

![A custom macOS main menu with a smiley]({{page.assets}}/custom-menu-smiley.png)

You can add keyboard shortcuts to any menu item to make it easy to trigger it from within the app:

```swift
@main
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            CommandMenu("Custom") {
                Button("Item 1") {}
                    .keyboardShortcut("x", modifiers: [.command, .shift, .option])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The macOS menu bar will then display these shortcuts as trailing instructions next to the button:

![Keyboard shortcuts]({{page.assets}}/keyboard-shortcut.png)

This is how you add new top-level menu items to the main menu. Let's take a look at how we can use commands to customize the standard menu items as well.


## How to customize standard menu items

You can add and remove items from standard menu items by adding `CommandGroup`s to `.commands`.

We can for instance customize the `Edit` menu by adding new `CommandGroup` items to the `commands`:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            CommandMenu("Custom") {
                Button("Item 1") {}
                    .keyboardShortcut("x", modifiers: [.command, .shift, .option])
            }
            CommandGroup(after: .undoRedo) {
                Button("Redo everything") {}
                    .keyboardShortcut("z", modifiers: [.command, .shift, .option])
            }
            CommandGroup(after: .undoRedo) {
                Divider()
                Menu("Import/Export") {
                    Button("Item 1") {}
                    Button("Item 1") {}
                    Button("Item 1") {}
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Since we used `after: .undoRedo`, the new menu item and sub menu is added after that menu item:

![A customized `Edit` menu:]({{page.assets}}/edit-menu-custom.png)

You can use `before:` to add new items before a certain item, and use `replacing` to replace an item.

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            CommandGroup(replacing: .undoRedo) {
                Divider()
                Menu("Import/Export") {
                    Button("Item 1") {}
                    Button("Item 1") {}
                    Button("Item 1") {}
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This will completely remove the `undo/redo` menu item from the edit menu:

![A further customized `Edit` menu:]({{page.assets}}/edit-menu-custom-2.png)

Note that the strongly typed items that SwiftUI provides only specify a couple of types, so you don't get full creative freedom.


## How to handle multiple windows

In multi-window apps, you must be able to identify which window a certain command should affect.

For instance, consider that we have an app in which we want to be able to affect some view-specific state with a menu bar command:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State var message: String?
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "globe")
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundStyle(.tint)
            Text("Hello, world!")
            if let message {
                Divider()
                Text(message)
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

The problem here is that a menu command can't access this `message` state. We must therefore find another way to communicate between the menu and the window.

Having a global singleton would not work, since multiple windows would then use the same state:

![Multiple open windows]({{page.assets}}/windows.png)

To fix this, we can use `focus values` to change state instance when focus moves between windows.


## How to implement custom focus values

To support focus, we must create a `FocusedValueKey` and bind it to the menu and the view. 

Let's start with creating a new, observable `MessageState` class to handle view-specific message state:

```swift
public class MessageState: ObservableObject {
    
    @Published var message: String?
}
```

Let's then create a `FocusedValueKey` implementation for the `MessageState` type, and extend `FocusedValues` with a property that lets us access this focused value:

```swift
public struct MessageStateFocusedValueKey: FocusedValueKey {
    
    public typealias Value = MessageState
}

public extension FocusedValues {
    
    typealias MessageState = MessageStateFocusedValueKey
    
    var messageState: MessageState.Value? {
        get { self[MessageState.self] }
        set { self[MessageState.self] = newValue }
    }
}
```

We can now add a `MessageState` class `@StateObject` to our view and use it instead of the `@State` we had before, then apply a `.focusedValue` modifier to the entire view:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @StateObject
    private var messageState = MessageState()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "globe")
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundStyle(.tint)
            Text("Hello, world!")
            if let reply = messageState.message {
                Divider()
                Text(reply)
            }
        }
        .padding()
        .focusedValue(\.messageState, messageState)
    }
}
```

We can now add a `@FocusedValue` property to `MyApp` and use it to set a message from the menu bar:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    
    @FocusedValue(\.messageState)
    var messageState: MessageState?
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            CommandMenu("World") {
                Button("Reply") {
                    messageState?.message = "Hey!"
                }
                .disabled(world == nil)
                .keyboardShortcut("r", modifiers: [.command, .shift])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The focused value will be `nil` when no view with a matching `.focusedValue` has focus. This makes it possible to disable the button when it wouldn't do anything.

However, in macOS, a window only becomes focused when a view within it is focused. Since we just have texts and dividers in our content view, these windows will therefore not be focused by default:

![Disabled menu command]({{page.assets}}/no-focus.png)

As you can see in this screenshot, the "Reply" menu item is disabled since the active window is not *focused*, and therefore doesn't set the focused value properly.

If we were to add a text field to the window, the menu item would become enabled while we edit it:

![Menu command enabled by text field]({{page.assets}}/focus-with-textfield.png)

We can however enable focus for any view, by applying a `.focusable()` modifier to the entire view:

![Menu command enabled by code]({{page.assets}}/focus-with-code.png)

Since the blue focus effect is not needed in this case, we can use `.focusEffectDisabled()` to hide it:

![Menu command enabled by code, without focus effect]({{page.assets}}/focus-without-effect.png)

We can now tap the menu item or use its keyboard shortcut to set a message for the focused view:

![A reply being shown in a single window]({{page.assets}}/reply.png)

If we close all windows, the focus value becomes `nil` and the menu button disabled. And with that, we can now consider ourselves to be menu bar experts.
