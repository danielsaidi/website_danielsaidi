The morning star has fallen
The shining son is cast aside
The horned beast is stirring
Dawn bringer, doomed by pride

Lucifer will rise, rise through the shadows
Lucifer will reign, reign with us by his side
Lucifer will rule, rule the burning skies
Lucifer, our lord

Oh, fallen son of Aušrinė
Disgraced shadow king of Vararinė
Shelter your ambitions
Bare your fangs and spread your wings

Build your realm in the underworld
Gather your legions and sharpen their blades
This exile will end
With our creator kneeling at our feet

Lucifer will rise, rise through the shadows
Lucifer will reign, reign with us by his side
Lucifer will rule, rule the burning skies
Lucifer, our lord

Bring your flames from the underworld
Command your legions to bleed the skies dry
This exile will end
With our creator hanging at the cross

Lucifer will rise, rise through the shadows
Lucifer will reign, reign with us by his side
Lucifer will rule, rule the burning skies
Lucifer will reign
