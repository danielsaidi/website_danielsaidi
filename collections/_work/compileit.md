I joined Compileit as a freelance mobile engineer, to help them optimize audio streaming in a watchOS app, and improve the code base and the app UI.

This work involved using the latest SwiftUI capabilities, and the Swift Package Manager to speed up development times and minimizing the feedback loop involved with watchOS, by moving UI components to a lightweight package.
