After keeping the Pickup, Prank & Quote Deck apps alive for 12 years, I'm finally sunsetting them to remove clutter from my life and allowing me to focus on fewer things.

![Header image]({{page.image}})

I created these apps with a few friends many years ago, with the idea to create many smaller card apps. 

Each app has a local database with items that share a common model, to let all apps share the same app foundation. Each app lets you swipe through its items as a deck of cards, mark items as favorites, etc.

<div class="grid col3">
<div><img src="{{page.assets}}prank-deck.png" /></div>
<div><img src="{{page.assets}}pickup-deck.png" /></div>
<div><img src="{{page.assets}}quote-deck.png" /></div>
</div>

Over time, keeping many small apps alive proved neither fun nor sustainable, so I made them free and kept polishing them, bumping them to SwiftUI, etc.

Over time, these apps laid the foundation to other card-based apps, like [Lunchrrrrr](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/lunchrrrrr/id1209779063), and an open-source project called [DeckKit](https://github.com/danielsaidi/DeckKit). So while these apps say goodbye, their foundation will live on.

It's crazy to think how these kind of small, fun apps were once a thing, and that people actually DID paid for them. ðŸ¤¯ However, times change and it's time to move on.

If you want to try the apps before I remove them from sale, you can download [Pickup Deck]({{page.pickup}}), [Prank Deck]({{page.prank}}), and [Quote Deck]({{page.quote}}) from the App Store all through January.
