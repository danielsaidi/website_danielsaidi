After some reflection on what I want with this blog, I've decided to make a slight shift in focus. From now on, I'll be focusing on things that I learn in my various projects, rather than aiming to cover the latest Swift & SwiftUI announcements, updates, and industry news.


## Why the Change?

The Swift and SwiftUI ecosystem moves incredibly fast. There are many excellent, established blogs and newsletters, that do a fantastic job of keeping us informed about what's new and noteworthy.

Rather than add to that noise, I want to focus on my personal learnings. I've realized that the most valuable content I can share isn't what everyone else is already talking about, but rather the unique journey of building things, making mistakes, and learning along the way.


## What's Coming Instead

This blog will now focus on:

* **Personal Projects and Experiments** - I'll share the apps, tools, and side projects I'm working on, including the messy middle parts where things don't work as expected.

* **Learning in Public** - When I encounter a challenging problem or discover something that clicks for me, I'll document that journey, and link to any open-source projects that arise from it.

* **Real-World Problem Solving** - Instead of theoretical examples, I'll focus on actual challenges I face in my projects and how I work through them.

* **Lessons from Failure** - Some of the best learning happens when things go wrong. I'll share the projects that didn't work out, the approaches that failed, and what I learned along the way.


## A More Authentic Voice

This shift allows me to focus on what I'm genuinely excited about, rather than feeling obligated to cover every new framework feature or API change. It means some posts might be more niche, but they'll be more authentic to my actual experience as a developer.

You might see posts about a small utility I built to solve a problem, a deep dive into a bug that took days to figure out, or reflections on how my approach to iOS development has evolved over time.

This does *not* mean that I will not write about SwiftUI in general. It just means that my ambition to every year cover what's new in Swift and SwiftUI will be toned down quite a bit. 


## What This Means for You

If you've been following this blog for a while, you'll probably not notice any major changes, since I've been focusing on personal projects for quite some time now. I just wanted to clearly establish what I will focus on going forward.

If you're interested in the human side of development, including the process of building, learning, and growing as a developer, I think you'll find this new direction more engaging.

I'm excited about this change because it allows me to share what I'm genuinely passionate about rather than trying to keep up with an endless stream of announcements. It's a return to why I started writing in the first place: to document and share the journey of building things with code.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you'll join me on this more personal exploration of development, one project and one lesson at a time.
