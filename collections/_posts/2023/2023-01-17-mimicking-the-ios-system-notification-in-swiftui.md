{% include kankoda/data/open-source.html name="SystemNotification" %}In this post, I'll show how you can use the [SystemNotificaton]({{project.url}}) open-source library to mimic iOS system notifications in your SwiftUI apps.

## What is SystemNotification?

[SystemNotificaton]({{project.url}}) is a `SwiftUI` SDK that lets you mimic the native iOS system notification, which is presented when you toggle silent mode on & off, connect your AirPods, etc.

This makes it possible to create notifications that behave almost like the native ones, which means that your app-specific notifications or hints can look right at home in iOS.

The SDK supports `iOS`, `macOS`, `tvOS`, `watchOS`, and `VisionOS`, which means that you can use the same notification engine on all platforms.


## Getting started

You must first add [SystemNotificaton]({{project.url}}) to your project with the Swift Package Manager. You can then apply `.systemNotification` just like you apply `.sheet`, `.alert` & `.fullScreenModal`:

```swift
import SystemNotification

struct MyView: View {

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, world")
            .systemNotification(...)
    }
}
```

You can use both state- and context and message-based notifications, use pre-defined or custom views and style your notifications to great extent.


## State-based notifications

State-based notifications work just like state-based sheets, alerts and modals. Just provide the `.systemNotification` modifier with an `isActive` binding and the view to present:

```swift
struct MyView: View {

    @State 
    private var isActive = false

    var body: some View {
        List {
            Button("Show") { isActive = true }
            Button("Hide") { isActive = false }
            Button("Toggle") { isActive.toggle() }
        }
        .systemNotification(
            isActive: $isActive,
            content: notificationView
        )
    }

    func notificationView() -> some View {
        Text("This is a custom notification")
            .padding()
    }
}
```

State-based notifications are easy to use, but context-based ones are much more versatile.


## Context-based notifications

Context-based notifications work similar to `sheet`, `alert` and `fullScreenModal`, but uses an observable `SystemNotificationContext` instead of state:

```swift
struct MyView: View {

    @StateObject 
    private var notification = SystemNotificationContext()

    var body: some View {
        List {
            Button("Show notification", action: showNotification)
            Button("Show orange notification", action: showOrangeNotification)
        }.systemNotification(notification)
    }
    
    func showNotification() {
        notification.present {
            Text("This notification uses a standard configuration")
                .padding()
        }
    }
    
    func showOrangeNotification() {
        notification.present(
            configuration: .init(backgroundColor: .orange)
        ) {
            Text("This notification uses a custom configuration")
                .foregroundColor(.white)
                .padding()
        }
    }
}
```

The context-based approach lets you use a single context and modifier to present different notifications from anywhere in your app.

You can apply a context-based notification to a root `TabView` or `NavigationView` to ensure that it's presented above all other content, regardless or where it's triggered.

Sheets and full screen covers require a new modifier, but you can use the same context. Also consider the platform when picking a proper notification approach.

For instance, iPad sheets are presented as square modals in the center of the screen, so a system notification may not be the best solution there.

Context-based notifications are versatile and a great choice if you want to present many different notifications with a single modifier.


## Message-based notifications

Message-based notifications mimic the native iOS look and feel, with a leading tinted icon, a title and a message. To mimic this notification, just use a `SystemNotificationMessage`:

```swift
struct MyView: View {

    @StateObject 
    private var notification = SystemNotificationContext()

    var body: some View {
        List {
            Button("Show notification", action: showNotification)
        }.systemNotification(notification)
    }
    
    func showNotification() {
        notification.present {
            SystemNotificationMessage(
                icon: Image(systemName: "bell.slash.fill"),
                title: "Silent Mode",
                text: "On",
                style: .init(iconColor: .red)
            )
        }
    }
}
```

The `style` parameter lets you modify the message style, colors, spacings etc. However, this only styles the message, not the notification. For that, use a `SystemNotificationStyle`.


## How to style a system notification

A `SystemNotification` can be styled in a couple of ways. For instance, you can provide a `style` in the view modifier, when you apply a system notification to a view:

```swift
struct MyView: View {

    @StateObject 
    private var notification = SystemNotificationContext()

    var body: some View {
        List {
            ...
        }.systemNotification(
            notification,
            style: .init(backgroundColor: .red)
        )
    }
}
```

This will be used as the default style, and applied to all notifications. You can however override this style whenever you present a notification with a context:

```
notification.present(
    style: .init(backgroundColor: .green)
) {
    Text("A green message")
        .foregroundColor(.white)
}
```

This custom style is applied for as long as the notification is presented, then reset to the default style.


## How to configure a system notification

Just like with the style, a `SystemNotification` can be configured in a couple of ways. For instance, you can provide a `configuration` in the view modifier:

```swift
struct MyView: View {

    @StateObject 
    private var notification = SystemNotificationContext()

    var body: some View {
        List {
            ...
        }.systemNotification(
            notification,
            configuration: .init(duration: 5)
        )
    }
}
```

This will be used as the default configuration, and applied to all notifications. You can however override it whenever you present a notification with a context:

```
notification.present(
    configuration: .init(duration: 10)
) {
    Text("An important, long-lived notification")
}
```

This configuration is applied for as long as the notification is presented, then reset to the default one.


## Putting things together

To wrap things up, let's present a system notification that looks like a iOS notification, but has a green background color, white content and stays longer on the screen.

All you need to do is to create a context and present it with a custom config and style:

```swift
struct Preview: View {

    @StateObject
    private var notification = SystemNotificationContext()

    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            NavigationView {
                List {
                    ForEach(1..<100, id: \.self) { item in
                        Text("\(item)")
                            .onTapGesture {
                                notification.present(
                                    configuration: .init(duration: 5),
                                    style: .init(backgroundColor: .green)
                                ) {
                                    SystemNotificationMessage(
                                        icon: Image(systemName: "\(item).circle"),
                                        title: "You tapped item \(item)",
                                        text: "This will disappear in 5 seconds",
                                        style: .init(
                                            iconColor: .white,
                                            textColor: .white,
                                            titleColor: .white
                                        )
                                    )
                                }
                            }
                    }
                }.navigationTitle("Demo")
            }.tabItem { ... }

            Text("2").tabItem { ... }
            Text("3").tabItem { ... }
            Text("4").tabItem { ... }

        }.systemNotification(notification)
    }
}
```

When we present this, the notification is presented over the `NavigationView` with some additional padding to the dynamic island:

![Notification above the navigation bar]({{page.assets}}above-nav.png)

To verify that the notification is also presented over the `TabView`, we can adjust the `style` to use the `bottom` edge instead of the default `top`:

```swift
.onTapGesture {
    notification.present(
        configuration: .init(duration: 5),
        style: .init(
            backgroundColor: .green,
            edge: .bottom
        )
    ) {
    ...
    }
}
```

When we present this, the notification is presented over the `TabView` as well:

![Notification above the navigation bar]({{page.assets}}above-tab.png)

As a bonus, you can use the same context in all tabs. The notification will be presented above the `TabView`, which means that it will not disappear when you change tab.



## Conclusion

The [SystemNotificaton]({{project.url}}) library can be used to mimic iOS system notifications on all major Apple platforms. If you give it a try, I'd be very interested in hearing what you think.
