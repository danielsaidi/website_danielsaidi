Let's fly away


(Slasktext fr√•n inspelning)

I saw you dance along the waterline
Moving slow but steady along the border line
My I know I'm sober now
Already won, already over
Already over

And on the street
People where calling your name
Selling bread in the start of something new
And you and and I. Were dancing on
Like we should when we first met

I can hold you in my arms
I could keep you out of harm
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

I could change you if I tried
I could change you into a lie
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that





When we first met

And all I saw was your smile
And all I saw was your happiness
Moving from side to side
Celebrating
Many people have tried and failed
You and I will try and fail
But it doesn't matter

Cause in time

Let's fly away
Let's fly away
Let's fly when the summer flies
