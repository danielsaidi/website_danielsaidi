Lunchrrrrr has been rewritten for iOS 16. It has an updated and cleaner UI, as well as an improved card drag responsiveness.

{% include kankoda/data/app.html name="Lunchrrrrr" %}
{% include kankoda/data/open-source.html name="ApiKit" %}{% assign apikit = project %}
{% include kankoda/data/open-source.html name="DeckKit" %}{% assign deckkit = project %}

{% include kankoda/grids/grid-screenshots.html images="lunchrrrrr-iphone-1,lunchrrrrr-iphone-2,lunchrrrrr-iphone-3" %}

Although this app was mostly created for fun, it's actually a pretty well-crafted app that uses [DeckKit]({{deckkit.url}}) to render the deck of cards and [ApiKit]({{apikit.url}}) that simplifies integrating with the Yelp API.

When creating this version, I could remove a lot of code due to new language features in Swift and new capabilities in the libraries the app uses. I also moved the Yelp API integration to ApiKit.

For more information about Lunchrrrrr, [download the app from the AppStore]({{app.appStoreUrl}}), or checkout the [app page]({{app.url}}) at the [Kankoda]({{site.kankoda}}) website.
