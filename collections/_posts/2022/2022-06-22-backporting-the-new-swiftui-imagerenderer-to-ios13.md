SwiftUI 4 introduces a new `ImageRenderer` that can render any SwiftUI view as an image in iOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16 & watchOS 9. Let's look at how to backport it to iOS 13.

{% include kankoda/data/open-source name="SwiftUIKit" %}


## Background

Before `ImageRenderer`, I used the following extension to render SwiftUI `View`s to an image:

```swift
#if os(iOS)
import SwiftUI

public extension View {
    
    func snapshot(origin: CGPoint = .zero, size: CGSize) -> UIImage {
        let window = UIWindow(frame: CGRect(origin: origin, size: size))
        let hosting = UIHostingController(rootView: self)
        hosting.view.frame = window.frame
        window.addSubview(hosting.view)
        window.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return hosting.view.renderedImage
    }
}

private extension UIView {
    
    var renderedImage: UIImage {
        UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(bounds.size, false, 0.0)
        let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()!
        layer.render(in: context)
        let image = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()!
        UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
        return image
    }
}
#endif
```

The extension lets you to specify a `size`, then uses a `UIWindow`, a `UIHostingController` and a `UIView` to render the view in a window with the provided size.

While the `ImageRenderer` supports all platforms but requires iOS 16 and aligned platform versions, this extension only supports iOS but does so all the way back to iOS 13.

This makes it possible for us to backport the `ImageRenderer` to iOS 13, to provide almost the same APIs as the native renderer. Let's take a look at how.


## Backporting ImageRenderer

When backporting `ImageRenderer`, we first need to make sure that we only add our own renderer to iOS 15 and earlier. If an app targets iOS 16, it should get the native renderer.

However, there doesn't seem to be a clean way to make a type unavailable for a certain upper OS version. `if #unavailable(iOS 16)` check cause a `"Statements are not allowed at the top level"` warning for types, and there is no `@unavailable` attribute.

To work around this, [Matt Massicotte]({{page.matt}}) has written a great [post]({{page.matt-article}}), in which he suggests using a `compiler` check instead, which lets us check the version of the Swift compiler. 

Since the native `ImageRenderer` is available in SwiftUI 4 and Xcode 14, we can make our own renderer unavailable in Swift 5.7 and later.

```swift
#if os(iOS) && compiler(<5.7)
import SwiftUI

public class ImageRenderer<Content: View> {
}
#endif
```

The `#if` check makes sure that the renderer is only available for iOS 15 and before, but it would be great to have an explicit `unavailable` check instead.

We can now define an initializer and properties for the renderer:

```swift
public class ImageRenderer<Content: View> {

    @MainActor
    public init(
        content: Content,
        size: CGSize,
        scale: CGFloat? = nil
    ) {
        self.content = content
        self.size = size
        self.scale = scale ?? UIScreen.main.scale
    }

    private let content: Content
    private let size: CGSize

    @MainActor
    public var scale: CGFloat
}
```

This initializer is a bit different than the native one. Since we'll use the extension that we saw earlier, we have to provide an explicit size when we create the renderer. 

We also add an optional scale parameter for convenience, to avoid having to specify it. Unlike the native renderer, we'll use the screen resolution instead of 1.

We can now copy the code from the extension to implement a `uiImage` property:

```swift
public class ImageRenderer<Content: View> {

    ...

    @MainActor
    public var uiImage: UIImage {
        let window = UIWindow(frame: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: size))
        let hosting = UIHostingController(rootView: content)
        hosting.view.frame = window.frame
        window.addSubview(hosting.view)
        window.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return hosting.view.renderedImage
    }
}

private extension UIView {

    var renderedImage: UIImage {
        UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(bounds.size, false, 0.0)
        let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()!
        layer.render(in: context)
        let image = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()!
        UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
        return image
    }
}
```

That's it! We can now use this backported renderer in the app that we created in [Monday's article]({{page.article}}) (about using the native `ImageRenderer`) instead of the native one:

```swift
extension ContentView {
    
    func generateSnapshot() {
        Task {
            let renderer = await ImageRenderer(
                content: viewToSnapshot("ImageRenderer"),
                size: CGSize(width: 150, height: 50))
            if let image = await renderer.uiImage {
                self.snapshot = image
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The generated snapshot looks great, since it uses the screen resolution by default:

Note that the backported renderer is only available in iOS. It's not available in macOS, tvOS or watchOS, since it uses iOS-specific functionality to generate the snapshot.


## Conclusion

The new `ImageRenderer` does a great job of rendering snapshots, but is only available for iOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16 & watchOS 9.

To provide a similar solution for older versions, we can backport a renderer that behaves like as the native renderer. This lets us use a backported version now and replace it later.

You can find a backported renderer in [SwiftUIKit]({{project.url}}). Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think.
