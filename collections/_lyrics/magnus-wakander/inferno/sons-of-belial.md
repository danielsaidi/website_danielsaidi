I turn away from the holy
I turn my eyes from the light
I give my blood to the darkness
I give my soul to the night

A son of Belial
As wrath ruptures my mind
As shadows fill up my essence
For him I turn malign

You hide behind your cracked walls
You hide in futile denial
Stone and bricks won’t keep you safe
From the sons of Belial

You can’t keep yourself hidden
You will join the demise
Your kin will join the demise
Your kin will lead the demise

You turn away from the holy
You turn your eyes from the light
You give your blood to the darkness
You give your soul to the night

Sons of Belial
As wrath ruptures your mind
As shadows fill up your essence
For him you turn malign

We turn away from the holy
We turn our eyes from the light
We give our blood to the darkness
We give our souls to the night

Sons of Belial
As wrath ruptures our minds
As shadows fill up our essence
For him we turn malign

We turn the world from the holy
We turn the world from the light
The world burns in the darkness
The world ends with a sigh

Sons of Belial
His wrath ruptures our minds
Shadows are all that’s rewarded
To the sons of Belial

To the sons of Belial
To the sons of Belial
True sons of Belial
All hail Lord Belial
