This year, I decided not to wait a whole year before installing the latest macOS
Mojave. I thus grabbed it as a beta...and now have a keybinding issue, where backslash
opens a help menu instead of typing `\`.

To restore the old pre-Mojave behavior, just open `Keyboard Settings` in `System
Preferences` and select `Shortcuts`. Select `Application shortcuts` then uncheck
`Show help menu`, like this:

After this, the standard backslash keybinding should work once again.
