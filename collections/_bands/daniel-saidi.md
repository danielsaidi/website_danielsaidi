I started my first band at 15, released and [an EP]({{page.midnightenlightened}}) at 18 and [a full-length album]({{page.forsaken}}) at 20. I've since then played in several bands and recorded numerous demos, that I really need to step up and release.

I have played everything from pop to metal, done vocals in all bands and guitars in some. I stopped playing in bands when I became a parent in 2008, but am slowly finding my way back to music.
