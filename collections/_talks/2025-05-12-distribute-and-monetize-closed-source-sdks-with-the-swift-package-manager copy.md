I gave this talk at [{{page.location}}]({{page.location-url}}), in Skopje, North Macedonia, in May 2025. on how to set up, distribute, and monetize a closed-source SDK with the Swift Package Manager.


## Abstract

Open-source is an amazing way to collaborate with others and share your work with the world, but it's not always the right choice. Certain scenarios demand a closed-source approach.

In this talk, we'll take a look at how to set up, distribute and monetize closed-source software with GitHub and the Swift Package Manager, and control access to commercial software with licenses.

We'll set up a dual-repository configuration, with a private source code package and a public one for distribution and documentation. We'll also look at how to sell and validate commercial licenses.

This talk covers development and business considerations, and offers insights for developers who are looking to commercialize their source code.
