With the blade drawn out I am coming to life
I’m coming to life
With your breath exploding inside, you are trying to hide
You’re trying to hide
With my senses sharpened I am going to find
I’m going to find
With your last remaining heartbeats you’re going to cry
You’re going to cry

I’ll slice, I’ll cut, I’ll stab, I’ll peel
I’ll do anything I can just to make you feel
I’ll connect your soul with the other side
It’s just another way for him to slip inside
I’ll craft your body to a vessel for gods
He will enter your void like the darkest of floods
You’ll grant him life

	You’ll grant me life

You’ll bleed, you’ll scream, you’ll beg, you’ll cry
I’ll do anything with you except to let you die
I’ll peel your skin off, piece by piece
It’s just another way for me to let him in
He’ll erase your essence, scream by scream
And let your pain remain inside him like an evil dream

Through my blade held high he is coming alive
He’s coming alive
With your skin peeled off as a gate he is sliding inside
He’s sliding inside
In your flesh exposed to the world he is coming alive
He’s coming alive
An evil reborn in this world is now hiding inside
He’s hiding inside

	Bring me to life

There’s nothing left to do
There’s nothing left to say
There’s no reason to pray
Just accept that this ancient being is finally

	Growing inside

There’s nothing left to do
There’s no more skin nor flesh
Defleshed you are the vessel
For the essence
Years of waiting finally over as he’s

	Coming alive

There’s nothing left to do
There’s only waiting 
for the pain to make him stronger
He will feed on all the feelings 
that the blade has brought to life in you

	Bring me to life!

Your flesh will heal, you’ll seem alive
But your body now belongs to the other side
You’re caught inside, you’ll never dieYou’re just a way to feed him as he’ll come alive
He’ll replace your conscience when it’s time
for the legions to be gathered for the end of times
You may seem alone, but you’re just one
There are many, many more like him left to come

	One more time
One more time I’ll skin and deflesh to invite another from the other side
	One more life
One more life I’ll prepare for the union with rulers of the other side
	One more sacrifice
One more sacrifice I’ll offer as I open gateways to the other side
	One more time
One more time I’ll skin and deflesh to invite the legions from the other side

They’ll bleed, they’ll scream, they’ll beg, they’ll cry
We’ll do anything with them except to let them die
We’ll peel their skin off, piece by piece
It’s just another way for us to let them in
You’re by my side as we dig deep
You’re outside always smiling while your inside weeps

	Bring us lives

They’ll fill the ranks up one by one
They’ll join us in the carving ’til the war is won
Their flesh will heal, like your once did
But their bodies only stand because of things we hid
They seem like few, but they’re not all
There are many, many more to come to heed the call

	Bring use lives

	Bring us alive

There’s nothing left to do
There’s nothing left to say
There’s no reason to pray
Just accept that these ancient beings are finally

	Growing inside

There’s nothing left to do
There’s no more skin nor flesh
Defleshed they are the vessel
For the essence
Years of waiting finally over as they’re

	Coming alive

There’s nothing left to do
There’s only waiting 
for the pain to make them stronger
They will feed on all the feelings 
that the blade has brought to life in them

	Bring me to life!

They’ll fill the world up one by one
Human carving human ’til the war is won
When no one’s left to stop this tide
There’s no reason anymore for them to hide inside
Strip off their skin, deflesh their bones
It’s time for ancient rulers to become their own
No more resistance life, it was all in vain
The only thing that’s left is never-ending pain

	No more time
No more time to save this realm of skin from the being from other side
	No more life
No more life is needed when this world is finally blending with the other side
	No more sacrifice
No more sacrifice is needed as they cross the gateway from the other side
	No more time
No more time will ever exist anymore, nevermore

Through your eyes hung high you see the world starting to die
It’s starting to die
Through your skin flung wide you feel the sun starting to die
It’s starting to die
Through your flesh removed from your bones you are starting to die
You’re starting to die
An evil reborn no longer needs you alive
Needs you alive

I slice, I cut, I stab, I peel
I travel through the realms just to make things feel
I connect new souls with the other side
Defleshing worlds for armies to slip inside
I craft their bodies to vessel for gods
For the end to fill the void like the darkest of floods
