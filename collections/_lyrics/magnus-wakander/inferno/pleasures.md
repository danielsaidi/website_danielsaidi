In these halls of trust
You walk the path of the just
Forsaking carnal pleasures
Never giving in to the lust

But whispers in the night
In the flickering of feeble light
As shadows dance and tempt
You let him slip inside

Black robes flung aside
He licks your skin dry
Cleaves you in a riveting dream
Wild shuddering as you smile

Desires hidden for too long
Gave it all up for just one night
Asmodeus, king of lust
You let him deep inside

The pleasures of Asmodeus - Smile
The pleasures of Asmodeus - Deny
The pleasures of Asmodeus - Cry
The pleasures of Asmodeus - Die

In these halls of broken trust
You crawl the path of the unjust
Forsaking your divine calling
For corrupted carnal lust

Damp robes flung aside
He licks your skin dry
Cleaves you in a shuddering sigh
Eruption as you die
