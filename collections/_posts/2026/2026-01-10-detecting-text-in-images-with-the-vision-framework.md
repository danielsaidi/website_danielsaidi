[Apple's Vision framework]({{page.docs}}) is a framework for on-device machine learning-based image analysis. Let's see how we can use it to extract text from images in our apps.


## Vision APIs

Vision is available on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS. Before WWDC25, it had 31 APIs:

At WWDC25, [Apple announced 2 new APIs]({{page.video}}) for reading documents and for smudge detection. Let's see how we can use these APIs to detect text in images.


## Detecting text in images

I currently use text recognition in my [Wally app]({{page.wally}}), to read text from items to simplify management:

![Wally app screenshot with parsed text]({{page.assets}}/wally.jpg){:width="250"}

By tapping the scan button, users can parse the images of an item and presents the detected texts in a picker. As you can see, multi-line texts are parsed as individual lines.


## Detecting text with an (old) VNRecognizeTextRequest

I first implemented this feature using an app-specific `VNRecognizeTextRequest` that returns detected text by calling a completion handler:

```swift
func createRequest(
    completion: @escaping (([String]) -> Void)
) -> VNRecognizeTextRequest {
    let request = VNRecognizeTextRequest { request, error in
        if let error = error { return print(error) }
        let observations = request.results as? [VNRecognizedTextObservation]
        guard let observations else { return }
        let texts = observations.compactMap { $0.topCandidates(1).first?.string }
        completion(texts)
    }
    request.recognitionLevel = .accurate
    request.usesLanguageCorrection = true
    return request       
}
```

To use this request with SwiftUI, I use an `ObservableObject` that writes text to a published property:

```swift
class TextRecognitionContext: ObservableObject {
    
    init() {}
    
    @Published var recognizedText: [String] = []
    
    func reset() { 
        recognizedText = [] 
    }
}

extension TextRecognitionContext {
    
    func recognizeText(in images: [ImageRepresentable]) {
        reset()
        let images = images.compactMap { $0.cgImage }
        for image in images {
            let requestHandler = VNImageRequestHandler(cgImage: image, options: [:])
            let request = createRequest { [weak self] texts in
                guard let self else { return }
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self.recognizedText.append(contentsOf: texts)
                }
            }
            do {
                try requestHandler.perform([request])
            } catch {
                // Handle error
            }
        }
    }
}
#endif
```

In the code above, I convert each image to a `CGImage`, then iterate over the images and perform the request with a `VNImageRequestHandler`. Each detection adds the detected lines of text to a published `recognizedText` property, which automatically updates the picker.

This works, but the code is quite old and uses `ObservableObject` instead of `@Observable`. Let's use the newer `RecognizeTextRequest` to simplify things and support concurrency.


## Detecting text with a RecognizeTextRequest

The new `RecognizeTextRequest` makes things a lot easier, since we don't need to use a completion:

```swift
func createRequest() -> RecognizeTextRequest {
    var request = RecognizeTextRequest()
    request.recognitionLevel = .accurate
    request.usesLanguageCorrection = true
    return request
}
```

We can then implement an async function that performs the text recognition and returns the result:

```swift
func recognizeText(
    in images: [ImageRepresentable]
) async throws -> [String] {
    let request = createRequest()
    let images = images.compactMap { $0.cgImage }
    var results: [String] = []
    for image in images {
        let observations = try await request.perform(on: image)
        let texts = observations.compactMap {
            $0.topCandidates(1).first?.string
        }
        results.append(contentsOf: texts)
    }
    return results
}
```

We can then define our context as `@Observable` instead of `ObservableObject`, to use modern SwiftUI:

```swift
@Observable class TextRecognitionContext {

    init() {}

    var recognizedText: [String] = []
}

extension TextRecognitionContext {

    func reset() {
        recognizedText = []
    }

    func recognizeText(
        in images: [ImageRepresentable]
    ) {
        reset()
        Task {
            do {
                let texts = try await recognizeText(in: images)
                await MainActor.run {
                    self.recognizedText = texts
                }
            } catch {
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This approach involves a little more code than before, but it's a lot easier to read and reason about.



## Text Recognizer Drawbacks

While the approach above works, a text recognizer returns unstructured text. Text that spans over multiple lines is separated in different lines, and it's up to us to make sense of it all.

Since the `RecognizeTextRequest` returns bounding boxes and contextual information, it's possible for us to group texts together. However, the new `RecognizeDocumentsRequest` that was introduced at WWDC 25 makes such manual operations obsolete. Let's see how we can use it to simplify things.



## Detecting text with a RecognizeDocumentsRequest

With `RecognizeDocumentsRequest` things become even easier. First, our app-specific request becomes even easier to set up, using a single configuration:

```swift
func createRequest() -> RecognizeTextRequest {
    var request = RecognizeDocumentsRequest()
    request.textRecognitionOptions.useLanguageCorrection = true
    return request
}
```

The text recognition also becomes a lot cleaner, where we parse a document per image and extract complete text paragraphs instead of individual lines:

```swift
enum RecognizeDocumentsRequestError: Error {
    case noDocumentFound
}

func recognizeText(
    in images: [ImageRepresentable]
) async throws -> [String] {
    let request = createRequest()
    let images = images.compactMap { $0.cgImage }
    var results: [String] = []
    for image in images {
        let observations = try await request.perform(on: image)
        guard let doc = observations.first?.document else {
            throw RecognizeDocumentsRequestError.noDocumentFound
        }
        let texts = doc.paragraphs.map { $0.transcript }
        results.append(contentsOf: texts)
    }
    return results
}
```

With this simple change, the parsing becomes a lot better, since multi-line texts now stick together:

![Wally app screenshot with parsed text]({{page.assets}}/wally-new.jpg){:width="250"}

The way in which we combine Vision requests with observable types makes it easy to use Vision in SwiftUI-based apps. The same approach can be applied to other Vision APIs.


## Conclusion

Where the old Vision APIs required you to create a request and a request handler, the new request types make things a lot easier. They also work well with SwiftUI observations and Swift concurrency.

Make sure to check out the great [video]({{page.video}}) where Apple presents the new  `RecognizeDocumentsRequest` in more detail. It can do so much more, like parsing and analyzing structured data:

![Vision parsed data]({{page.assets}}/vision-data.png){:class="plain"}

I'm very impressed by these new tools, and will try to use them more in my various apps and SDKs.
