I joined BookBeat as iOS & Mobile Architecture Lead in 2016, after the first iOS release. While there, BookBeat went from 4 to 28 markets and 500k+ monthly users.

As iOS Lead, I refactored the iOS app from an app monolith to a package-based system, that powered apps for iOS, watchOS, tvOS & CarPlay.

We started migrating the app from UIKit to SwiftUI as it launched in 2019, and was the first regional audiobook service to support CarPlay & watchOS with download support.

Besides the pure technical parts, iOS also focused on accessibility, and had early support for dark mode, voice over, high contrast colors, dynamic type, etc.
