If I haven't written for a while, something may have happened. It could be an accident or something else. Since I prefer to be well-prepared, here are some final words, in case they're needed.

When I was about to undergo surgery in June, I started thinking about the small risks involved with both surgery and anaesthesia. While they are small, there are still risks involved, which got me thinking about how to handle if something unexpected would happen. I therefore setup a script to republish my site on a daily basis, both to let me prepare future content, but also to be able to pre-publish a post like this.

Writing my final words on a blog may perhaps be a bit pretentious, but hey - let's call it being prepared!


## Life

Most of you who read this post are probably here for the tech content. I'd be amazed if not, since it's the main topic of this website. However, there are some other aspects of life that I'd love to take up.

To my family - Johanna, Cornelia and Lovisa - I can't express in words how much I love you and what you mean to me. I will always love you to the stars and back. The same to my mom and dad - Ingrid and Sasan, my brothers Sebastian and Patrick, my niece Julia and family-in law: Gunvor, Sture, Karin, Lars, Theo, Rasmus, Berit, Sören, Lilian and Kjell - love you all!


## Music

Besides tech, let me plug some [music]({{page.music}}). Make sure to listen to my latest album [Soul Bleed]({{page.album}}), that I recorded with Magnus Wakander. If I'm to die at a semi-young age, let's at least make it as famous as Mozart.

Thanks to [Misfortune]({{page.bands}}misfortune) for being my first musical family, which I with many random acts of teeenagerism didn't always deserve. Thanks to [New Wave Stoner / x:o / sgt. Black]({{page.bands}}sgt-black) for being my new family in our new home town. Thanks to [Kollektivet]({{page.bands}}kollektivet) for taking on and improving my C G Am F creations and for humoring my song-writing ambitions.

For the songs that are not yet up on any streaming services, please reach out to my wife Johanna and request that she publishes my many unpublished demos that I have. But not before carefully mastering and polishing each song to perfection. But then again, the world could use a little more imperfection. I'll leave that decision up to you.



## Open-source

In the case of my demise, I hope that you take good care of my various [GitHub repositories]({{page.github}}). Fork them, nurture them and make sure they remain well-behaved and take care of the people who rely on them.

If you are a KeyboardKit Pro user, I will setup a way for you to get access to the source code. If I haven’t contacted you with this information before this post goes live, I failed in my ambitions. If so, reach out to my wife - Johanna Saidi - on LinkedIn and she will help you out.

With that said, I hope that this post never goes live. If it does, it has been nice to have you as a reader. Sorry for the somewhat morbid tone in this post. I guess it comes with growing up in the ironic 90's. I'll try to be better in my next life.

Love

Daniel Saidi
